Canadian Avalanche AssociationThe Canadian Avalanche Association (CAA) is a non-profit society incorporated in Alberta and British Columbia with its headquarters in Revelstoke, B.C.No portion of this publication may be reproduced without the express written permission of the CAA. No abridgement of this report may be published without the written authority of the CAA. Extracts may be published for the purposes of review only.Copyright of this publication belongs to the CAA.AbstractThe type, techniques and recording format employed when taking observations for operational snow stability assessment and avalanche hazard forecasting are described in this manual. These guidelines and standards cover the weather, characteristics of the snowpack, in-situ strength tests of the snow and occurrences of avalanches.Definitions for use in technical discussion of snow stability and forms forreporting avalanche accidents and avalanche damage are appended.
PrefaceThis manual describes the terminology, techniques and data codes recommended by the CAA for taking and recording observations of avalanches, snowpack and mountain weather.In Canada, avalanche safety programs are integral to public and private sector operations involving highways, railways, parks, forestry, mining, lift-based ski areas, industrial/construction zones, and backcountry recreation involving helicopters, snowcats, snowmobiles, ski touring, snowboarding, ice climbing, mountaineering, snowshoeing, etc. The scale of operations varies widely from highway avalanche safety programs, where many winter staff operate along a well-defined corridor, to that of a commercial guide who meets clients at a trailhead for a day of backcountry travel. This manual describes standard techniques for observations relevant to many avalanche safety programs; however, it does not specify which observations or observation frequencies are relevant to any particular operation. An observer should select the observations that give relevant information to best achieve the objectives outlined in each section. The CAA intends that the enclosed terminology, techniques and data codes facilitate sound record keeping and information exchange between the wide variety of avalanche safety programs in Canada.Additional observations not described in these guidelines include slope testing using explosives, ski-cutting, snowmobiles or other machines, previous slope use, local wind effects, incoming and outgoing radiation, probing by probe and ski pole, settlement of the snowpack, loading, and non-standard shear and stability tests. Many of these observations have no formal data collection procedures but are carried out as required.Part 1 describes daily snow and weather observations used for evaluating changes in snow stability. Observations made at a study plot are considered, as well as field observations made over a broader area of terrain. Measurements made to these standards may be reported to the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC). This section draws on knowledge and guidance from World Meteorological Organization (WMO) standards.Part 2 describes techniques for snowpack observations, including profile work and snowpack tests. Snow crystal classification and symbols are taken from the International classification for seasonal snow onthe ground (Fierz et al., 2007), a complete listing of which is given in Appendix D. Guidelines for the interpretation of snow profiles and snowpack tests are not given. For guidance on interpretation, the reader is referred to the CAA Instructor Training Program manuals (Operations Level 1 and Level 2 in particular), as well as Chapters 6, 7 and 8 of The Avalanche Handbook, 3rd Edition (McClung and Schaerer, 2006).Part 3 describes recording standards for avalanche observations. Avalanches that involve people, damage to property, or near misses for either are referred to as incidents. Fatal incidents must be reported in the first instance to the RCMP. Avalanche Canada (formerly the Canadian Avalanche Centre) is responsible for maintaining the database of avalanche incidents in Canada. An avalanche incident report form is given in Appendix B.Experience has shown that observations are best recorded in a standard surveyor’s field-book with waterproof pages and a hard cover. An accurate, complete and legible field-book not only assists the analysis of thedata, but could prove to be an important document when questions arise about the cause of avalanches in the event of accidents. In order to assist observers in maintaining good records, examples of field-book notes are included in this document. With the advent of mobile computing, more options for recording field observations are becoming available. It is worth giving careful thought to maintaining a well-organized digital record collection, especially if paper records are being phased out in your operation.
The CAA plans to re-examine this document periodically through a committee appointed for that purpose. Considerations for revisions are:• omissions• ambiguities• significant discrepancies in terms with those of other agencies• new techniques for accepted observations• new observations which become accepted for standard use  • clarification of observation techniques and applications Users are invited to comment and recommend changes at any time.

AcknowledgementsIn 1981, a dedicated group of researchers and practitioners produced the first edition of these guidelines and standards. The initiative was led by P. Schaerer with major contributions being made by P. Anhorn of the National Research Council, V. G. Schleiss and W. Schleiss of Parks Canada at Rogers Pass, and G. L. Freer of the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Highways.A second edition was published in 1989 after consultation with the guiding industry and ski area operators, Parks Canada and the B.C. Ministry of Transportation. The committee was composed of H. Bleuer, R. McCarthy, W. Schleiss and J. Johnson. P. Schaerer chaired the committee and edited the review.A third edition was published in 1995. The 1995 revisions were made by a committee selected to represent a broad spectrum of interest in snow safety and the avalanche industry in Western Canada and the Atmospheric Environment Service (AES). The committee was chaired by P. Weir and included P. Amann, R. Atkins, J. R. Bezzola, T. Geldsetzer, B. Jamieson, K. Little, T. Riley, D. Skjonsberg and G. Thompson. The publication and distribution of the 1995 version was made possible with support from the National Search and Rescue Secretariat.A fourth edition, incorporating suggestions received since 1995 was drafted in 2001 and published in 2002. The revisions were drafted by a committee chaired by D. Kelly. The committee included J. Goodrich, S. Gould, B. Jamieson, T. Riley, R. Whelan, and D. Wilson. The changes were reviewed by D. McClung, B. Sayer and S. Walker. Final revisions were compiled by R. Whelan and B. Strand. Translation into the French language was by M. Deschenes.Revisions for the fifth edition were made in 2007 and addressed input from the CAA Technical Committee, the Canadian avalanche community as well as international stakeholders. A working group, representing all aspects of the Canadian avalanche community, was chaired by B. Mark and included S. Aitken, R. Atkins,S. Conger, D. Gautier, J. Goodrich, M. Klassen, M. Rubenstein, C. Stethem, I. Storm and S. Walker. The revisions were approved by the CAA Technical Committee, which was chaired by R. Whelan and included B. Jamieson, D. McClung, B. Sayer and D. Wilson. C. Campbell coordinated the revision project and compiled the final revisions.Revisions for the current (sixth) edition were made in 2014 by the CAA Technical Committee following a period of consultation with CAA members to allow for comments and suggestions. The CAA TechnicalCommittee comprised: C. Campbell, D. McClung, B. Jamieson, B. Sayer, R. Whelan, J. Floyer and S. Garvin. Significant input was provided by P. Haegeli, D. Gauthier, and R. Simenhois. C. Campbell was responsible for coordinating the revision project and compiled the final revisions.

1. Weather and snow observations1.1 ObjectivesSnow and weather observations represent a series of meteorological and snow surface measurements taken at a properly instrumented study plot (refer to Appendix A). Observational data taken at regular intervals provide the basis for recognizing changes in stability of the snow cover and for reporting the weather to the meteorological office.In the long term, observations may be used to improve the ability to forecast the avalanche hazard by statistical and numerical techniques, and to increase climatic knowledge of the area. Observations should be complete, accurate, recorded in a uniform manner and made regularly.1.2 Types of observationsObservations taken at regular daily times are referred to as standard observations. Manual observations are typically carried out at 0700 and 1600 hours, but the type of operation and availability of observers might necessitate different frequencies and times. If only one standard observation is taken per day, that observation should be made in the morning. Recording instruments (i.e. maximum and minimum thermometers) are reset only when taking a standard observation.Observations taken between the standard times are referred to as interval observations. They are taken when the snow stability is changing rapidly (i.e. during a heavy snowfall). Interval observations may contain a few selected observations or a complete set of observations.Observations taken at irregular times are referred to as intermittent observations. They are appropriate for sites that are visited infrequently; visits will typically be more than 24 hours apart and need not be regular (i.e. in a heli-ski operation). Intermittent observations may contain a few selected observations or a complete set of observations (see Figure 1 for sample of field-book entry).1.3 EquipmentA study plot usually contains the following equipment:* Stevenson screen for housing thermometers (height adjustable)* Maximum thermometer* Minimum/present thermometer* Two snow boards (about 40 centimetres (cm) x 40 cm) designated as the 24-hour board and the storm board* Snow stake, a snow depth marker (graduated in cm), and leveling stick* Ruler (graduated in cm)* Snow density cutter and weigh scale (graduated in grams (g)), or precipitation gauge* Knife or plate for cutting snow samples* Field-book (water resistant paper)* Loupe and crystal screenThe following additional equipment is useful:* Hygrothermograph located in a Stevenson screen* Recording precipitation gauge or rain gauge* One to three additional snow boards* First section of a Ram penetrometer* Barograph (in the office) or barometer/altimeter* Anemometer at a separate wind station with radio or cable link to a recording instrument
* Box (shelter) for the equipment* Small broom* Snow shovel1.4 ProcedureRecord location and elevation of the study plot at the top of the field-book page, or on the title page. Performand record observations in the sequence listed below. Wear gloves when touching the instruments.1.4.1 DateRecord year, month and day, yyyy-mm-dd (e.g. December 5, 2016 is noted as 2016-12-05).1.4.2 TimeRecord time of observation using a 24-hour clock (avoid spaces, colons, etc.).Use local time (i.e. Pacific or Mountain time, as appropriate). Operations that overlap time zones shouldstandardize to one time (e.g. 5:10 p.m. is noted as 1710).1.4.3 Sky conditionClassify amount of cloud cover and record it with one of the symbols below.ClassSymbolData codeDefinitionClear‚CLRNo clouds.Few‡FEWFew clouds; less than 2/8 of the sky is covered with clouds.ScatteredƒSCTPartially cloudy; 2/8 to 4/8 of the sky is covered with clouds.BrokenˆBKNCloudy; more than half but not all of the sky is covered with clouds ( more than 4/8 but less than 8/8 cover).Overcast…OVCThe sky is completely covered (8/8 cover).Obscured†XA surface-based layer (i.e. fog) or a non-cloud layer prevents observer from seeing the sky. Unable to determine vertical extent of surface based layer.Valley fog and valley cloudWhere valley fog or valley cloud exists, estimate the elevation of the bottom and top of the fog layer in metres(m) above sea level. Give the elevation to the nearest 50 m. Data code is VF with bottom and top elevations separated by a hyphen.Example: Clear sky with valley fog layer between 1050 m and 1200 m is coded as CLR VF 1050-1200.Thin cloudThe amount of cloud, not the opacity, is the primary classification criterion. Thin cloud has minimal opacity, such that the disk of the sun would still be clearly visible through the clouds if they were between the observer and the sun, and shadows would still be cast on the ground. When the sky condition features a thin scattered, broken or overcast cloud layer then precede the symbol with a dash.
Example: A sky completely covered with thin clouds is coded as — OVC.1.4.4 Precipitation type and intensityNote the type and rate of precipitation at the time of observation. Snowfall is recorded in centimetres of snow accumulation per hour. Rainfall is observed in millimetres of rain per hour.Precipitation typeSymbol anddata codeDescriptionNILNo precipitationRRainSSnowRSMixed rain and snowGGraupel and hailZRFreezing rainPrecipitation rate (specify for rain and snow only):Symbol and data codeDescriptionSnowfall intensity (this system is open-ended; any appropriate rate may be specified)S -1Snow accumulates at a rate of less than 1 cm per hour.S1Snow accumulates at a rate of about 1 cm per hour.S2Snow accumulates at a rate of about 2 cm per hour.S3Snow accumulates at a rate of about 3 cm per hour.S10Snow accumulates at a rate of about 10 cm per hour.Rainfall intensityRVVery light rain; would not wet or cover a surface regardless of duration.RLLight rain; accumulation of up to 2.5 millimetres (mm) of water per hour.RMModerate rain; accumulation of 2.6 to 7.5 mm of water per hour.RHHeavy rain; accumulation of more than 7.5 mm of water per hour.1.4.5 Air temperatureRefer to Appendix A for detailed procedures on the use of thermometers, thermographs and hygrographs. All temperatures are measured in degrees centigrade (oC). Read the maximum thermometer immediately after opening the Stevenson screen. Secondly, read the present temperature from the minimum thermometer. Thirdly, read the minimum temperature from the minimum thermometer.Note:	Read all air temperatures from thermometers to the nearest 0.5 degree.
Read the air temperature from the thermograph and record to the nearest one degree. Use an arrow symbol to record the temperature trend shown on the thermograph over the preceding three hours.SymbolData codeDescriptionRRTemperature rising rapidly (> 5 degree increase in past 3 hours).RTemperature rising slowly (1 to 5 degree increase in past 3 hours).STemperature steady (< 1 degree change in past 3 hours).FTemperature falling slowly (1 to 5 degree decrease in past 3 hours).FRTemperature falling rapidly (> 5 degree decrease in past 3 hours).At the end of the temperature observation:• Remove any snow that might have drifted into or accumulated on top of screen.• Reset thermometers after standard observations (refer to Appendix A).• If Stevenson screen is fitted with a height adjustment mechanism ensure that screen base is 1.2 m to 1.4 mabove the snow surface.• Check that the screen door still faces north if any adjustments are made.1.4.6 Relative humidity (RH)Read the relative humidity to the nearest one percent (%) from the hygrograph.Note:	Hygrographs are inaccurate at low temperatures. Furthermore, the accuracy of any mechanical hygrograph is unlikely to be better than 5% but trends may be important especially at high RH values. Refer to Appendix A for information on instrument calibration.Humidity measurements are more relevant from mid-slope or upper-elevation sites than from valley-bottom sites.1.4.7 Snow temperaturesSnow surface temperature (T0): Measure snow surface temperature by placing the thermometer on the snow surface and shade the thermometer.10 cm snow temperature (T10): Insert the thermometer horizontally 10 cm below the snow surface and shade the snow surface above the thermometer.Allow the thermometer to come to equilibrium and then read the thermometer while the bulb or thermistor is still in the snow. Observe snow temperatures to the nearest fraction of a degree based on the accuracy of the thermometer.Note:	Digital thermometers are preferred as most display in increments of 0.1 degree.1.4.8 Depth of snowfallUse a ruler to measure (in cm) the depth of snow accumulated on snow boards. Take measurements in several spots on the board. Calculate the average of the measurements and record to the nearest centimetre. Record “0.1” when the depth is less than 0.5 cm (do not consider surface hoar on the boards as snowfall; clear off hoar layer after observation).
Clear the snow board after sampling the weight of new snow. Redeposit the snow in the depression left by the snow board then reposition the board level with the surrounding snow surface.Note:	Snowfall should be measured on at least two snow boards: the “24-hour” “or “HN24” and the “storm” or “HST” board. Additional snow boards (i.e. interval, twice-a-day, or shoot) may be used as required by the operation.Board naming conventionsInterval (HIN): An interval board is used to measure the accumulated snow in periods shorter than the time between standard observations. The interval board is cleared at the end of every observation.24-Hour (HN24): The HN24 board is used to measure snow that has been deposited over a 24-hour period. It is cleared at the end of the morning standard observation. (In earlier editions of these guidelines the HN24 board was called the HN board).Twice-a-day (H2D): An H2D board is used to measure the depth of snow that has accumulated since the last standard observation. The H2D board is cleared at the end of each standard observation.Note:	If readings are limited to one standard observations taken in the morning then the H2D board is not used.Storm (HST): Storm snowfall is the depth of snow that has accumulated since the beginning of a storm. The storm board is cleared at the end of a standard observation prior to the next storm and after useful settlement observations have been obtained. The symbol “C” is appended to the recorded data when the storm board is cleared.Intermittent (HIT): Snow boards may be used at sites that are visited on an occasional basis. Snow that accumulates on the board may result from more than one storm. The intermittent snow board is cleared at the end of each observation.Shoot board (HSB): The shoot board holds the snow accumulated since the last time avalanches were controlled by explosives. The symbol C is appended to the recorded data when the shoot board is cleared.1.4.9 Total depth of snowpack (HS)Observe the total depth of snow cover on the ground by reading the calibrated permanent stake to the nearest centimetre. If necessary, level settling cones, wells, drifts, etc. around the stake.Note:	Snow board and HS values are always measured vertically (i.e. line of plumb).1.4.10 Mass of new snowDetermine the mass of new snow when the depth is 4 cm or more. With a snow sampling tube, cut a sample of snow vertically from the H2D snow board and weigh it. If only one standard observation is taken each day the sample is taken from the HN24 board. Record the mass of snow in grams.Take a sample from the interval board for interval observations.Note:	Similar measurements can be taken from other boards.
Make a note of the cross-section area (cm2) of the snow sampling tube at the top of the page or on the titlepage of the field-book.1.4.11 Water equivalent of new snow (H2DW or H24W)Calculate the water equivalent of the new snow as follows: Divide the mass (g) of new snow by the cross- section area of the snow sampling tube (measured in cm2) and multiply by 10 (refer to Appendix C for expanded equations). Record the water equivalent to the tenth of a millimetre.
H2DW (mm) ?
Mass of new snow (g)Cross - section area of sampling tube (cm2 )
?10
H2DW is the water equivalent of the snow on the H2D board; HINW is the water equivalent on the HIN board, etc.Note:	The water equivalent is the depth of the layer of water that would form if the snow on the board melted. It is equal to the amount of precipitation.The water equivalent of the new snow can be obtained either by melting a sample of snow and measuring the amount of melt water (i.e. with the aid of the rain gauge) or by weighing a snow sample. Weighing is commonly applied for avalanche operations because of its ease. The simplicity of conversion is an additional advantage as 1 cm3 of water weighs 1 g.Snow depth must be recorded in centimetres (cm) but water equivalent of snow, as well as rainfall in millimetres (mm).1.4.12 Density of new snow (?)Density is a measure of mass per unit volume; density must be expressed in SI units of kg/m3. The Greek symbol rho (?) is used to represent density.Calculate density as follows: Divide the mass (g) of new snow by the sample volume (cm3) and multiply by 1000 to express the result in kilograms per cubic metre (kg/m3). Record as a whole number.? ? kg ? ? Mass of new snow (g) ?1000? m3 ?	Sample volume (cm3 )?	?Where:? Diameter of sampling tube (cm) ?2
Sample volume (cm3 ) ? ??
? ? Depth of new snow (cm) ? 3.142	?
Alternatively, if the water equivalent of a snow sample is available, density can be computed as follows: Divide the water equivalent (mm) of the snow on the snow board by the snow height (cm) from that board and multiply by 100. Record as a whole number.

Empty the gauge at each standard observation.Note:	A manual rain gauge should be placed on the ground or on the snow surface when rainfall is likely to occur.1.4.14 PrecipitationRecord the amount of precipitation accumulated in the recording precipitation gauge to the nearest millimetre.Note:	Precipitation gauges collect snowfall, rainfall and other forms of precipitation and continuously record their water equivalent.The amount of precipitation that has fallen into the gauge since the last observation is the difference between the present reading and the previous reading.1.4.15 Surface penetrability (P)An indication of the snowpack’s ability to support a given load can be gained by the following three tests. Note that Ram penetration is the preferred method of observation of penetrability because it produces more consistent results than ski or foot penetration.Ram penetration (PR)Let the first section of a standard Ram penetrometer (cone diameter 40 mm, apex angle 60o and mass 1 kg) penetrate the snow slowly under its own weight. Do not allow the Ram penetrometer to accelerate. Read the depth of penetration in centimetres.Foot penetration (PF)Step into undisturbed snow and gently put full body weight on one foot. Measure the depth of the footprint to the nearest centimetre from 0 to 5 cm and thereafter, to the nearest increment of 5 cm.Note:	The footprint depth varies between observers. It is recommended that all observers working on the same program compare their foot penetration. Observers who consistently produce penetrations more than 10 cm above or below the average should not record foot penetrations.
Ski penetration (PS)Step into undisturbed snow and gently put full body weight on one ski. Measure the depth of the ski track to the nearest centimetre.1.4.16 Form and size of surface snowRecord the form and size in millimetres of snow grains at the surface using Appendix D.Note:	Experienced observers may use the sub-classes for precipitation particles and surface deposits and crusts (Appendix D).1.4.17 WindObserve and record the wind direction and speed in the vicinity of the observation plot.Distinguish between estimates and measurements of wind. Measurements are made with an instrument located at a fixed point. Estimates are made without instruments but typically represent wind in a local area rather than at a fixed point.Wind observations (speed and direction) should be averaged over a two-minute period prior to the observation.Wind speedThe Canadian standard for measuring and coding wind speed is kilometres per hour (km/h).Note:	The SI unit for wind speed is metres per second (m/s). Refer to Appendix A of The Avalanche Handbook, 3rd Edition, McClung and Schaerer (2006), for a discussion of SI units.Estimate the wind speed by observing the motion of trees, flags and snow.ClassSymbol and data codeEquivalent measured wind speedTypical visual indicator(km/h)(m/s)CalmC00No air motion; smoke rises vertically.LightL1-251-7Light to gentle breeze; flags and twigs in motion.ModerateM26-408-11Fresh breeze; small trees sway, flags stretched and snowbegins to drift.StrongS41-6012-17Strong breeze; whole trees in motion and snow drifting.ExtremeX> 60> 17Gale force or higher; difficulty in walking and slight toconsiderable structural damage occurs.Note:	The indicators used to estimate wind speed are established by rule of thumb. Observers should develop their own relationships specific to their area.Note the occurrence of severe gusts in Comments.
Wind directionMeteorological standards require that measured wind direction data from all sites including automatic stationsbe rounded to the nearest 10 degrees. (i.e. 184 degrees is coded as 180). Forty-five degrees is coded as 050.Estimate the direction from which the wind blows at the site with respect to the eight cardinal points of the compass.If the wind direction is erratic, record as Variable (VAR).Do not record a direction when the wind speed is 0 km/h or calm.1.4.18 Blowing snowEstimate the current extent of blowing snow, or wind transported snow, and note the direction, to the closest cardinal point of the compass, from which the snow is blowing.Extent of blowing snowClassSymbol anddata codeTypical visual indicatorTypical threshold wind speedNilNilNo evidence of blowing snow.CalmLightLLimited and localized blowing snow; snow is transported in rolling and saltation modes.LightModerateMWindward erosion and leeward deposition of blowing snow; snow is transported in saltation and turbulent suspension modes; visibility becomes obscured.ModerateIntenseIWidespread scouring; extensive downwind transport of snow in turbulent suspension mode; highly variable deposition.Strong1.4.19 Barometric pressure at stationThe SI unit of kilopascal (kPa) is used for reporting pressure; specify to two decimal places.A variety of instruments including barographs, barometers, altimeters and electronic sensors can be used to obtain a measure of the barometric pressure. Measurement units vary between hectopascal, kilopascal, millibars, millimetres and inches of mercury depending on instrument (refer to Appendix C for multipliers used to convert to kPa).Absolute pressures and trend are valuable for weather forecasting while trend alone is often sufficient inavalanche operations.Pressure tendencyUse an arrow symbol to record the pressure tendency as indicated by the change of pressure in the three hours preceding the observation.Record the change in barometric pressure in the past three hours.

1.5 Field weather observations1.5.1 ObjectivesAvalanche workers in the field often observe local weather conditions during their daily operations. These observations are an important tool in helping evaluate slope-specific snow stability and avalanche hazard to ensure the safety of the party. In addition, when factored together with other field and study plot observations, field weather observations may be incorporated into a stability and hazard analysis and forecast for the operational region.1.5.2 Relevant measurementsIt is not necessary to measure every variable when undertaking field weather observations. No fixed rule applies about the type and amount of information to be collected. An observer should select the observations that give significant information to achieve the objectives outlined above.1.5.3 Frequency and location of observationsThere is no rule regarding the frequency of field weather observations. The number of readings should be adequate to achieve the objectives outlined above. Experienced workers will often make a field weather observation when they first embark on their field trip, when they arrive at a high or a low point for the day, when they change aspect, at midday, or when the weather conditions are changing.1.5.4 ProcedureThe following are guidelines for the type of observations that may be recorded during a field weatherobservation.Date and timeRecord date and time as outlined in Section 1.4.LocationRecord the location using latitude and longitude, grid reference, named feature or a short description of the spot.ElevationMeasure or estimate the elevation in metres.Sky conditionClassify the amount of cloud cover and measure or estimate the elevation of valley fog as outlined in Section 1.4.3.If both bottom and top of the valley fog was observed within a few minutes of each other (during a helicopter flight or while skiing downhill), record both the elevations of the valley fog as well as the sky cover (i.e. valley fog between 1200 m and 1750 m with scattered clouds above is recorded as SCT VF 1200 - 1750).If not all of these conditions could be observed, record the ones that were and use a tilde (~) for the others (i.e. if the bottom elevation is 1200 m but the field teams did not get above the valley fog to observe the top elevation or sky condition, record as ~ VF 1200 - ~).
Precipitation type and intensityEstimate the type and rate of precipitation as outlined in Section 1.4.4.Air temperatureObserve the air temperature in the shade about 1.5 m above the snow surface. Use a dry thermometer, read after about five minutes, wait another minute and read again. Record the temperature if there is no change between the two readings. Observe the air temperature to the nearest 0.1 or 0.5 of a degree (C) based on the scale increment (analog or digital) of the thermometer.Depth of interval snow (HIN)Estimate the amount of snow that has fallen since the most recent field weather observation.Depth of storm snow (HST)Estimate the amount of snow that has fallen during a period specified in hours (i.e. 56 cm in the past 36hours).Total depth of snowpack (HS)Estimate the depth of the snowpack. Probing several spots is useful in determining an average depth in the immediate area.Surface grain form and sizeRecord the surface grain form and size either as an estimate or measured as per Section 1.4.16.Wind speed and directionEstimate wind speed and direction as shown in Section 1.4.17.Blowing snowEstimate the extent and direction of previous and current blowing snow as outlined in Section 1.4.18.CommentsMake any additional comments or observations as required. These may include foot penetration, ski penetration, intensity of valley fog, etc.1.6 Field weather summary1.6.1 ObjectivesField weather summaries are used to create a clear and concise picture of which weather conditions encountered in the field are relevant to creating a final stability and hazard analysis and forecast for the operational region. The objective of such a summary is to filter out the extraneous data that is not required for this decision-making.Field weather summary parameters are different from field weather observation parameters in that they are not recorded at a specific location and time but are a general summary of the range of conditions encountered in a broader geographical area during the field day.
1.6.2 FrequencySummaries are generally done once a day, after the field day is completed.1.6.3 ProcedureThe parameters to be recorded in a field weather summary are as follows:DateRecord the date as described in Section 1.4.1.Time periodThe time range during which field weather observations were made.Locations and elevation rangeThe locations and elevation range where field weather observations were made. Many operations will recorda drainage as a single location.Percent of area observedThe area observed recorded as a percentage of the entire operational region.Sky conditionThe average amount of cloud cover and the average top and bottom elevations of valley fog.Precipitation type and intensityThe average precipitation type and intensity encountered.High and low temperatureRecord the high and low temperatures observed.Field HN24The estimated average amount of snow that fell during the 24-hour period ending at the finish of the field day.Field HSTThe estimated average amount of snow that fell during a period specified in hours as described inSection 1.5.4.Field HSThe average depth of snow on the ground. If the depth is highly variable throughout the area observed, indicate for which areas the depth is representative.Surface form and sizeThe average surface condition encountered or distribution of surface form if variable throughout the area observed.
Wind speed and directionThe average estimated wind speed and direction.Blowing snowThe average estimated extent and direction of blowing snow.CommentsMake any additional comments as required. These may include notes on foot penetration, ski penetration, intensity of valley fog, signs of previous blowing snow, etc.1.7 RecordingAlways record the names (initials are fine) of observers with the primary observer listed first. Use a tilde (~) in the notebook when no observation was made. Code as “U” if the observation was attempted but no reliable value could be ascertained (i.e. when blowing snow cannot be observed due to darkness, cloud or fog). Do not leave blanks. Only write “0” when the reading is zero (i.e. when no new snow has accumulated on the new snow board).
2. Snowpack observations2.1 Full snow profileA full snow profile is a multi-observation record of snow-cover stratigraphy including characteristics ofindividual layers and layer interfaces.2.1.1 ObjectivesThe objectives of observing full snow profiles in avalanche work are:• To identify the weak and strong layers that make up the snowpack.• To identify weak interfaces between layers and to determine their relative strength.• To observe snow temperatures.• To monitor and confirm changes in the condition, stratigraphy, temperature and stability of the snowpack.• To determine the thickness of a potential slab avalanche.• To determine the state of metamorphism of the snow.Generally, full snow profiles are observed to gather class II information about the snow cover. In addition, the information can be used for climatological studies, forecasts of snow melt runoff, and studies of the effect of snow on vegetation, wildlife and structures.2.1.2 Site SelectionStudy PlotFull snow profile observations are carried out at study plots (refer to Appendix A) by excavating each snow pit progressively in undisturbed snow. Excavation is parallel to a line marked with two poles indicating the extreme edge of previous pit disturbance and at a distance into the undisturbed area about equal to the snow depth, but at least 1 m from the previous one. After each observation, the extreme edge of the pit is marked with a pole to indicate where to dig the next pit (i.e. at least 1 m from that point).The snow profile observation line and area should be selected and marked before the winter, and the groundbetween the marker poles cleared of brush and large rocks.On SlopeThe best information with respect to snow stability is obtained from snow profiles taken at avalanche starting zones. Since starting zones are not always accessible, other slopes should be selected provided that they are undisturbed, safe and representative of the conditions in starting zones. These study slopes may be pre- selected and marked in the same manner as study plots; however, marker poles on slopes will be tilted by snow creep and may have to be periodically reset. A full profile can be at a targeted site selected to satisfy a particular observation objective.2.1.3 Frequency of observationsNo firm rules can be set on how frequently snow profiles should be observed. Frequency is dependent on climate, terrain and type of avalanche operation. Usually profiles are observed at regular intervals and whenever changes in snow conditions are suspected.2.1.4 EquipmentRecommended equipment for snow profiles:• Collapsible probe• Snow shovel
• Snow thermometer• Ruler (graduated in cm)• Loupe or magnifying glass (10x to 20x magnification)• Crystal screen• Snow density cutter and appropriate scale• Field-book• Pencil• Gloves• Compass• Altimeter• Inclinometer• Any additional equipment required for snowpack tests (i.e. a snow saw)Additional useful equipment for snow profiles:• Brush• Spare thermometer• Extra pencil• Camera• Global positioning system (GPS) receiver• Calculator• Safety belay rope (see The Avalanche Handbook, 3rd Edition)Thermometers should be calibrated periodically in a snow-water mixture. Glass thermometers must be checked for breaks in the mercury or alcohol columns before every use.Field-book should be prepared (record labels and column headings) before the observer goes to the observation site.2.1.5 Field procedureEquipmentKeep all observation equipment in the shade. Wear gloves when handling the instruments.Checking snow depthUnless the profile is observed on a study plot, check the snow depth with a probe before digging the observation pit; make sure the pit is not on top of a boulder, bush or in a depression. Feel the hardness of the snow with the probe and obtain a first indication of weak or stiff stratigraphy.Digging the pitMake the hole wide enough to allow for multiple observations and to allow shoveling at the bottom. In snow deeper than 2 m it is advantageous to dig first to a depth of about 1.5 m, make the observations, then complete the excavations and observation to the necessary depth. Pile extracted snow such that the undisturbedregion remains so. Exercise caution in piling debris so it does not reflect solar radiation into the observationpit (particularly in the later part of the season). The pit face on which the snow is to be observed must be in the shade. Cut the observation face and an adjacent side vertical and smooth. On inclined terrain it is advantageous to make the observations on a face parallel to fall line.While the first observer prepares the pit, the second observer begins observations.
Date and timeRecord date and time.LocationRecord location, elevation, aspect and slope inclination.Weather observationsObserve air temperature, sky condition, precipitation and wind as described in Section 1.5.4. Observe surface penetrability as described in 1.4.15.Snowpack temperature (T)Observe snow temperatures to the nearest 0.1 or 0.5 of a degree (C) based on the scale increment (analog or digital) of the thermometer.Measure snow surface temperature by placing the thermometer on the snow surface and shade the thermometer.Push the thermometer horizontally to its full length parallel to the surface into the snow (use the shaded side-wall of the pit on a slope). Wait at least one minute, then read with the bulb/tip still in the snow. Whenmaking measurements within the top 30 cm of the snowpack, shade the snow surface above the thermometerin order to reduce influence of radiation.Measure the first sub-surface snow temperature 10 cm below the surface. The second temperature is observed at the next multiple of 10 cm from the previous measurement, and from there in intervals of 10 cm to a depth of 1.4 m below the surface, and at 20 cm intervals below 1.4 m. Closer measurements can be made when the temperatures are near to 0 oC or when gradients are strong.Begin the next observation while snow temperatures are being measured.Note:	Compare thermometers first when two or more are used simultaneously. Multiple thermometers should be of identical style only.Punch a hole in the snowpack with the metal case or a knife before inserting the thermometer into very hard snow and at ground surface.It is important to regularly (semi-monthly) check the accuracy of all thermometers by immersing them in a mixture of water and ice slush; each should read 0.0 oC. If possible, recalibrate or note variation from 0.0 oC on the thermometer.Layer boundaries (H)Determine the location of each major layer boundary using a combination of visual and tactile techniques. Determine weak layers or interfaces of layers where failure might occur. In the field-book record layer boundaries by their distance from the ground or snow surface (Figure 2).Note:	When using a brush to highlight layering, it is suggested that a repeatable and reproducible method will provide consistent and satisfactory results.
Layer datingLayers that are significant or used in referencing specific surface conditions of formation can be named by thedate the layer was buried. This is most commonly done regarding rain crusts or surface hoar.Snow hardness (R)Observe the relative hardness of each layer with the hand test. Record the object that can be pushed into thesnow with moderate effort parallel to the layer boundaries.Data codeHand testTermSymbolFFist in gloveVery lowNone4FFour fingers in gloveLow/1FOne finger in gloveMediumXPBlunt end of pencilHigh//KKnife bladeVery highIToo hard to insert knifeIce?Note:	In Canadian practice, the maximum force required to push the described object into the snow is 10 to 15 Newtons (1 to 1.5 kg-force), which contrasts with the 50 Newton (5 kg) force specified in Fierz, et al., in press. Gloves are worn when this test is undertaken.Slight variations in hand hardness can be recorded using + and - qualifiers (i.e. P+, P, P-). A value of 4F+ isless hard than 1F-.Grain form (F)Appendix D presents the classification scheme which is used in this document. The more detailed subclass scheme from the classification should, in general, only be used by experienced observers (refer to Appendix D).Note:	Use 10x to 20x hand lens; lower power does not provide adequate resolution for shape and higher power does not provide adequate field of view for bond identification.Any basic group may be sub-classified into different forms of solid precipitation according to Appendix D.
In warm weather the crystals may melt and their shape may change rapidly on the crystal screen. In this case, a quick decision must be made and repeated samples taken from various depths of the same layer.Note:	The use of a subscript “r” modifier is retained to denote rimed grains in the Precipitation Particles (PP) class and its subclasses except for gp, hl and ip and all of Decomposing and Fragmented Particles (DF) class.Snow layers often contain crystals in different stages of metamorphism. The classification should refer to the predominant type, but may be mixed when different types are present in about equal numbers. A maximum of two grain forms, primary and secondary, may be displayed for any single layer with the secondary grain form recorded in parenthesis.(Illustrations and photographs of various grain forms may be found in the following publications: LaChapelle, 1969; Perla, 1978; Fierz, et al., in press; McClung and Schaerer, 2006.)Grain size (E)Determine the grain size in each layer with the aid of the screen. In doing so, disregard small particles and determine the average greatest extension of the grains that make up the bulk of the snow. Record the size or range of sizes in millimetres. Record size to the nearest 0.5 mm except for fine and very fine grains which may be recorded as 0.1, 0.3 or 0.5 mm.Where two distinct grain forms exist in a layer, record the size of the secondary grain form in parenthesis. Example: 0.3 (2.5).Where a range in sizes exist for any single grain form, specify the minimum and maximum size separated by a hyphen. Example: 0.5-1.5.Both notations may be mixed. Example: 0.5-1.0 (2.5).The following table contains terms that can be used to describe grain size. These terms should not be used infield notebooks. Always document grain size with digits.TermSize (mm)Very fine< 0.2Fine0.2 to 0.5Medium0.5 to 1.0Coarse1.0 to 2.0Very coarse2.0 to 5.0Extreme> 5.0Liquid water content (?)Classify liquid water content by volume of each snow layer that has a temperature 0 oC. Gently squeeze a sample of snow and observe the reaction.
ClassDefinitionWater content (by volume)SymbolData codeDryUsually the snow temperature (T) is below 0 oC, but dry snow can occur at any temperature up to 0 oC.Disaggregated snow grains have little tendency to adhere to each other when pressed together, as in making asnowball.0 %NoneDMoistT = 0 oC.

The snow is flooded with water and contains arelatively small amount of air.> 15 %| | | |SNote:	In alpine snow measurable liquid water is present only when the snow temperature is zero degrees centigrade.Density (?)Measure density of the snow in layers that are thick enough to allow insertion of the snow density cutter. Accuracy of density measurements relies in part on the orientation of the cutter when it is inserted. Tube- or box-shaped cutters should be used for thin layers in the method described below.Sample densities from the pit face when working on flat terrain and from the pit sidewall when on an incline. Insert box or large (500 cm3) tube-shaped cutters horizontally. Insert wedge and small (100 cm3) tube shaped cutters with the long axis vertical (i.e. the opening of the tube facing down or the bottom of the wedge cutter vertical). Do this perpendicular to the layering when on an incline. When inserting a tube shaped cutter vertically, clear the snow from above the sample area and place a flat cutter or crystal screen at the depth equal to the long axis dimension. Trim the ends, remove excess external snow, and weigh. Volume of thin layers that do not fill the tube cutter can be calculated in the same manner as using a tube for new snow density (area of tube opening, pi times the radius squared, times the layer thickness).Record weight under Comments and calculate density. Record cutter volume under Comments. Take an appropriate number of samples in thicker layers to provide an average density.Calculate density as follows: Divide weight (g) of snow sample by sample volume (cm3) and multiply by 1000 to express result in kg/m3.? ? kg ? ? Mass of snow sample (g) ?1000? m3 ?	Sample volume (cm3 )?	?
Where:? Diameter of cutter (cm) ?2
Sample volume (cm3 ) ? ??
? ? Length of cutter (cm)? 3.142	?
Note:	When multiple samples within one layer are averaged, the resulting value is described as average layer density.Density measurements that include more than one layer are described as bulk density.When using a 500 cm3 density cutter use the following calculation: Multiply net weight of snow in the cutter by 2. Multiply by 5 for a 200 cm3 and 10 for a 100 cm3 cutter.Strength and stability testsPerform tests of strength and stability as appropriate for slope angle of profile. See Sections 2.6 to 2.10 fortest descriptions. Record under Comments.Marking the siteFill the pit and place a marker pole at the extreme edge if you plan to undertake further studies at that site.2.1.6 Water equivalent of snow cover (HSW) (optional snow profile calculations)The water equivalent is the vertical depth of the water layer which would form if the snow cover was melted. Information about water equivalent is needed for certain applications.Water equivalent of the snowpack (mm) can be approximated from the density of the layers as follows: Multiply the thickness (cm) of each layer by its density (kg/m3) and sum the products over the full depth of the snow.HSW (mm) ?	?Vertical thickness (cm) ?

Code as “U” if the observation was attempted but no reliable value could be ascertained (i.e. when blowing snow cannot be observed due to darkness, cloud or fog). Do not leave blanks.

Test profiles may be used to supplement data from study plots. The variation of snow structure with aspect and elevation is recorded and correlated with conditions observed at study plots. Repetition of test profiles (and most other tests) allows an observer to track changes over space and through time.2.2.2 Site SelectionCriteria used for site selection depend on the objective of the test profile. Test profiles are often observed where snow conditions are similar to avalanche starting zones. As with full profiles they can be targeted sites selected to satisfy a desire for a particular observation. When selecting a site, keep in mind that elevation and exposure to wind and sun are the factors that have the strongest influence on the variations of the snow cover.
Profile locations should be at least 5 m from the tip of tree branches and not be in a depression, and not contain avalanche debris or tracks from skis, vehicles or animals. Safety considerations are paramount in selecting a site; consider the potential hazard of avalanches from above and the runout below.2.2.3 Frequency of observationsNo rule can be set about the frequency of test snow profiles. The number of profiles should be adequate tosupplement other observations relating to snow stability.2.2.4 Relevant measurementsIt is not necessary to measure every variable when undertaking a test snow profile. No fixed rule exists about the type and amount of information to be collected. Observations may concentrate on the identification of weak layers and their relation to other layers, or may contain snow temperatures only (i.e., during snow melt periods), or may have all the information of a full snow profile (i.e., in a shallow snowpack). An observer should select the observations that give significant information about the stability of the snowpack at a specific site and time.The pit for a test snow profile needs to be excavated deep enough to observe weak layers and relevant temperatures. The depth should be known approximately from continuously monitoring the development of the snowpack during the winter, full snow profiles and probing.Test snow profiles may be recorded in a format similar to that of full snow profiles.2.2.5 EquipmentEquipment required for a test snow profile depends on the observations being made. Refer to Section 2.1.4 for a list of reccommended equipment for snow profiles.2.2.6 Procedure1. With a probe or ski pole, determine the approximate location of weak layers, the depth necessary for the pit and the total snow depth.2. Record date, time, names of observers, location, elevation, aspect, inclination of terrain, sky cover, precipitation and wind.3. Observe the air temperature in the shade about 1.5 m above the snow surface.4. Measure foot penetration.5. Dig the pit and cut a smooth face on the shady side to allow for the identification of layers.6. Measure the snow temperatures as necessary.7. Determine the location of significant layers and record their distance from the ground or the snow surface.8. Observe the hardness, crystal shape, grain size and free water content of significant layers.9. In a general comment describe any terrain features, vegetation, sun and wind effects on the snowpack and note any evidence of past avalanche activity which may influence the snowpack structure.Perform strength and stability tests where appropriate.2.2.7 RecordingAlways record the names (initials are fine) of observers with the primary observer listed first. Use a tilde (~) in the notebook when no observation was made. Code as “U” if the observation was attempted but no reliable value could be ascertained (i.e. when blowing snow cannot be observed due to darkness, cloud or fog). Do not leave blanks. Only write “0” when the observation is zero (i.e. the incline when the profile is performed at a level site).

Identification of the slab layer(s), weak layer(s) and bed surface(s) are of prime importance. Information is sought on the strength of the weak layer and the effect of loading from the layers above, grain form and size in the weak layer and snowpack temperatures. Knowledge of the snowpack structure at avalanche sites contributes to a better understanding of the avalanche phenomenon.2.3.2 Site SelectionSafety considerations are paramount when selecting a site for fracture line profiles. Consider the potential for and consequences of further releases. A pit may be dug into the flanks or the crown face. If more than a short time has passed since the avalanche, dig into the exposed crown or flank at least 1 m in a manner that allows tracing the bed surface and failure planes to the profile face.Observations can be taken at both thick and thin sections of a fracture line. Supplementary information on strength and stability may be obtained from a similar undisturbed site.Use a sketch to describe location. Carefully describe terrain features, vegetation, and sun and wind effects on the snowpack. Note any evidence of past avalanche activity which may have influenced the snowpack’s structure.
2.3.3 Relevant measurementsThe following should be given special attention during full or test snow profiles:• Dig the observation face into undisturbed snow at least 1.5 m back into the crown face or flank. Dig downbelow the depth of the bed surface.• Note the location of, and the crystal shape, grain size and temperature in the initial failure plane and bed surface.• Measure incline of the terrain with an inclinometer.• Record the exact location of the profile with respect to the avalanche fracture geometry.2.3.4 RecordingAlways record the names (initials are fine) of observers with the primary observer listed first. Use a tilde (~) in the notebook when no observation was made. Code as “U” if the observation was attempted but no reliable value could be ascertained (i.e. when blowing snow cannot be observed due to darkness, cloud or fog). Do not leave blanks. Only write “0” when the observation is zero (i.e. the incline when the profile is performed at a level site).2.4 Ram profile2.4.1 ObjectiveThe Ram profile is a record of relative hardness of snow layers measured with a Ram penetrometer. It can be applied on its own as an index of snow strength but it is not recommended for use in snow stability. When used in combination with a snow profile, the Ram profile should be taken about 0.5 m from the pit wall after observation of the snow profile, but before any shovel shear tests are performed. The Ram is used in lieu of the ruler for layer heights during profile observations. In two stage profiles (deeper than approximately 2 m) the Ram is inserted to ground in the corner of the hole to reference the layer boundaries from the ground.Then the deeper stage is dug along the lower Ram sections.Note:	The Ram profile typically describes the hardness of strong layers in the snowpack. It has two distinct shortcomings when used in snow stability work:• It often fails to identify thin weak layers in the snowpack.• Its sensitivity is dependent on the hammer and tube weights, particularly when used in soft or very soft snow.Refer to Chapter 7 of The Avalanche Handbook, 3rd Edition (McClung and Schaerer, 2006) for a discussionon Ram profiles.2.4.2 EquipmentThe Ram penetrometer, also called Rammsonde, consists of:• A sectional tube with a cone of 40 mm diameter and an apex angle of 60°.• Multiple extension tubes.• A guide rod.• A hammer of mass 2 kg, 1 kg, 0.5 kg, 0.2 kg or 0.1 kg.The mass of hammer chosen depends on the expected hardness of the snow and desired sensitivity.2.4.3 Unit of measurementRam hardness is measured by the force that must be applied in order to penetrate the snow with the Ram penetrometer. The weight of the tubes and hammer, and a dynamic load from the falling hammer produce this force.
Weight is a gravity force that is calculated by multiplying mass with acceleration due to gravity. The average value of acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s2 but the approximate value of 10 m/s2 is adequate for the purpose of measuring Ram hardness.Forces, and consequently the Ram hardness, are measured in Newtons. A mass of 1 kg has a gravity force (weight) of 1 kg x acceleration which is approximately 1 kg x 10 m/s2 = 10 N.Note: The observation of surface penetrability (refer to Section 1.4.15) for Ram penetration provides the depth at which the Ram hardness exceeds 10 N.2.4.4 Procedure1. Record type and weight of Ram penetrometer and hammer at the head of the field-book page. Obtain theweight by multiplying its approximate mass by 10.2. Work in pairs; one person holds the Ram penetrometer in a vertical position, drops the hammer and counts the number of blows; the other person observes depth of penetration and records information.3. Let the first sectional tube slowly penetrate the snow under its own weight. Record its weight in columnT + H. Read the penetration (cm) and record in column p.4. Carefully add the guide rod and hammer. Record weight of the tube plus weight of the hammer under T+ H. Read the new penetration and record in column p.5. Drop the hammer from a height between 1 cm and 5 cm; note the penetration. Continue dropping the hammer from the same height until rate of penetration changes. Record fall height (f), number of blows(n) and penetration (p) up to the point before rate of penetration changed. Continue with another series of blows; choose a fall height that produces a penetration of about 1 cm per blow.6. Add another section of tube when necessary and record the new T + H.2.4.5 Calculation1. Calculate the increment of penetration (p) for each series of blows.2. Calculate Ram hardness (R) with:R ? n ? f ? H ? T ? H?pWhere:R	= Ram hardness (N)n	= number of blows of hammer f	= fall height of hammer (cm)p = increment of penetration for n blows (cm)T	= weight of tubes including guide rod (N) = 10 x mass (kg) H	= weight of hammer (N) = 10 x mass (kg)3. Plot on graph paper the Ram hardness versus depth of snow.2.4.6 RecordingAlways record the names (initials are fine) of observers with the primary observer listed first. Use a tilde (~) in the notebook when no observation was made. Code as “U” if the observation was attempted but no reliable value could be ascertained (i.e. when blowing snow cannot be observed due to darkness, cloud or fog). Do not leave blanks. Only write “0” when the observation is zero (i.e. when the increment of penetration is zero).

Plot a tilde (~) when hardness or liquid water content could not be determined (a blank implies fist hardness or dry snow respectively). Use of graphic symbols for hardness is optional.• Tabulate grain size and density with values observed in the field.• Include written comments where appropriate. If possible, label important layers by their date of burial.• Include results of appropriate strength and stability tests in the comments column. Document grain form and size of the failure layer. Draw an arrow at the height of each observed fracture and use a shorthand notation to describe the test (i.e. CTM 17 (SC) down 34 on SH 8 mm Jan 22).• When Ram data are not taken, plot the hand test results of snow hardness as a horizontal bar graph. Use the following lengths of bars for scale.

The observation site must be level and the snow surface must be undisturbed by wind for meaningful and reproducible test results.2.6.3 EquipmentThe shear frame test requires the following equipment:• Metal cutting plate about 30 cm x 30 cm• Shear frame, usually 100 or 250 cm2 area• Force gauge, maximum capacity 10 to 25 N (1 to 2.5 kg)• Snow sampling tube• Weigh scale• Ruler• Tilt board (optional)2.6.4 ProcedureLocating the weak layerThere are several ways of finding a weak layer. The method described here is for study plots with tilt boards.1. Cut a block of undisturbed snow with sides about 30 cm x 30 cm, and a 30 to 40 cm depth. A second deeper block of similar size must be collected if the suspected failure plane is deeper than 0.4 m.2. Lift the snow block with the cutting plate onto the horizontal tilt board.3. Tilt the board to an angle of about 15°. Tap the board gently until a shear fracture occurs in the snow.4. Measure depth of the failure plane from the surface at the side of the block; record under “Shear depth”.5. Collect a sample of snow on the tilt board by inserting sampling tube (perpendicular to the snow surface) to the depth of the failure plane. Weigh sample and record net weight under “Shear weight”.6. Establish location of the failure plane in the snowpack by measuring shear depth from the surface.
Shear frame test1. Remove overlying snow with a cutting plate leaving a few centimetres of undisturbed snow above failure plane.2. Gently push the shear frame, by holding it with thumb and index finger, down through the snow to a fewmillimetres above failure plane.3. Zero the force gauge, then hook it to the frame and pull parallel to failure plane. Read and record the force required to produce a fracture.4. Repeat process several times to confirm consistency.2.6.5 ResultsShear frame testThe shear frame test, as part of snow and weather observations, may be recorded at the bottom of the field-book page for snow and weather observations, or on a separate page if necessary. Note the area of the shear frame and the cross-section area of the sampling tube.Stability ratioDetermine shear strength by dividing the force (g) at fracture by the area (cm2) of the shear frame.Determine weight of snow per unit area by dividing weight (g) of the snow sample by the cross-sectional area (cm2) of the sampling tube.Calculate stability ratio by dividing shear strength by weight per unit area:
Stability ratio ?   
Shear strength (g/cm2 ) Weight per unit area (g/cm2 )
2.6.6 Recording(Refer to Section 2.6.5)2.6.7 LimitationsUnits of measurementStability ratio (previously termed a stability factor) has no units of measurement. However, it is preferable to use SI units rather than metric units in its calculation.With SI units the shear force should be expressed in Newtons and the shear frame index in Pascals (1 Pa = 1 N/m2). Since available spring balances may be calibrated in other metric units, gram (g) and gram per square centimetre (g/cm2) may be used for both the shear force index and weight per unit area.ReliabilityExperience is required to produce reliable data. Success of the test depends on:• Carefully removing the snow block above without disturbing the layer to be tested.• Inserting the shear frame parallel and close to the failure plane without causing a premature fracture.• Pulling the shear frame at a constant rate.

2.7 Rutschblock test2.7.1 ObjectiveThe rutschblock (or glide-block) test is a slope test that was developed in Switzerland in the 1960s. These guidelines are based on a recent Swiss analysis of rutschblock tests (Fohn, 1987) and on Canadian research (Jamieson and Johnston, 1993).2.7.2 Site selectionTest sites should be safe, undisturbed and representative of the avalanche terrain under consideration (i.e. to gain information about a wind-loaded slope, find a safe and undisturbed part of a similarly loaded slope for the test). The site should not contain buried ski tracks, avalanche deposits, etc., or be within about 5 m of trees where buried layers might be disturbed by wind action or by clumps of snow which have fallen from branches. Although Dr. P. Fohn (1987) recommends slope angles of at least 30°, rutschblocks on 25 to 30 degree slopes also give useful information (discussed below). Be aware that near the top of a slope, snowpack layering and hence rutschblock scores may differ from the slope below.2.7.3 EquipmentEight metres of 4 to 7 mm cord with overhand knots tied every 20 or 30 cm can be used to cut the upper wall and both sides of the block at the same time (provided no hard crusts are encountered). Long rutschblock- specific snow saws are useful to cut hard crusts.2.7.4 ProcedureAfter identifying weak layers (and potential slabs) in a snow profile, extend the pit wall until its width is at least 2 m minimum across the slope. Do not omit the profile unless the layering is already known.Mark width of the block and length of the side cuts on the surface of the snow with a ski, ruler, etc. The block should be 2 m wide throughout if the sides of the block are to be dug with a shovel. However, if the side walls are to be cut with a ski, pole, cord or saw, the lower wall should be about 2.1 m across and the top of the side cuts should be about 1.9 m apart (refer to Figure 6). This flaring of the block ensures it is free to slide without binding at the sides. The side cuts should extend 1.5 m up the slope.The lower wall should be a smooth vertical surface cut with a shovel. Dig or cut the side walls and the upper wall deeper than any weak layers that may be active. If the side walls are exposed by shovelling, then one rutschblock test may require 20 minutes or more for two people to perform.If the weak layers of interest are within 60 cm of the surface, save time by cutting both the sides and upper wall of the block with a ski pole (basket removed) or with the tail of a ski. If weak layers are deeper than 60 cm and the overlying snow does not contain any knife-hard crusts, both the sides and upper wall of the block can be sawed with cord which travels up one side, around ski poles or probes placed at both upper corners of the block and down the other side.Once completely isolated from the surrounding snowpack, the block is progressively loaded by a person on skis or snowboard. Loading steps are outlined in Section 2.7.5.2.7.5 ResultsThe following chart outlines the loading sequence (1-7) in a rutschblock test:
FieldscoreLoading step that produces a clean shear fractureData code1The block slides during digging or cutting, or anytime before the block is completely isolated.RB12The tester approaches the block from above and gently steps down onto the upper part of the block (within 35 cm of the upper wall).RB23Without lifting heels, the tester drops from straight leg to bent knee position, pushing downwards and compacting surface layers.RB34The tester jumps up and lands in the same compacted spot.RB45The tester jumps again onto the same compacted spot.RB56For hard or deep slabs, remove skis or snowboard and jump on the same spot. For soft slabs or thin slabs where jumping without skis might penetrate through the slab, keep equipment on, step down another 35 cm (almost to mid-block) and push once then jump three times.RB67None of the loading steps produced a smooth slope-parallel fracture.RB7Release typeWhen observing rutschblock tests, observe the amount of the block that releases for each weak layer fracture according to the following table:TermDescriptionData codeWhole block90 - 100% of block.WBMost of block50 - 80% of block.MBEdge of block10 - 40% of block releases on a planar surface.EB2.7.6 RecordingRecord rutschblock score, release type, weak layer properties and comments. The exact percentage of the block which released can be recorded in the comments if relevant.<data code> <(release type)> <reference point> <location in profile> <”on” layer characteristics (form, size,date of burial if known)> <comments>Indicate the reference point for the fracture position (down = from surface; up = from ground). The snow surface is the default reference point for measuring fracture location. Measure down from the snow surface and record location of the fracture in the profile. When location of the fracture is measured up from the ground, record the reference point as up and indicate this clearly in the comments.Example: A rutschblock fractures on the first jump. A planar fracture occurs beneath the skis and approximately 60% of the block releases on a layer of 6 mm surface hoar that is 75 cm below the snow surface and was buried on January 22.Record as: RB4 (MB) down 75 on SH 6.0 Jan 222.7.7 LimitationsThe rutschblock is a good slope test but it is not a one-step stability evaluation. This test does not eliminate the need for snow profiles or careful field observations nor does it, in general, replace other slope tests such as ski cutting and explosive tests.
The rutschblock only tests those layers deeper than ski or snowboard penetration (i.e. a weak layer 20 cm below the surface is not tested by skis snowboards that penetrate 20 cm or more). Higher and more variable rutschblock scores are sometimes observed near the top of a slope where the layering may differ from the middle and lower part of the slope (Jamieson and Johnston, 1993). Higher scores may contribute to an incorrect decision.Effect of slope angleRutschblock results are easiest to interpret if the tests are done in avalanche starting zones. However, since there is a general tendency for rutschblock scores to increase by 1 for each 10 degree decrease in slope angle (Jamieson and Johnston, 1993), scores for avalanche slopes can be estimated from safer, less steep slopes (as shallow as 25°).Note:	Rutschblocks done on slopes of less than 30° require a smooth lower wall and a second person standing in or near the pit to observe the small displacements (often less than 1 cm) that indicate a shear fracture.2.7.8 Test ConfigurationFigure 6 Rutschblock tester positions and dimensions for a block with the sides exposed by shoveling or cut with a saw, cord, ski or pole (in parenthesis).2.8 Shovel shear test2.8.1 ObjectiveThe shovel shear test provides:• Information about the location where snow could fracture in a shear.• A qualitative assessment of weak layer strength.2.8.2 Site selectionSelect a safe site that has undisturbed snow and is representative of the slopes of interest.2.8.3 EquipmentThe equipment required is the same for test snow profiles, (refer to Section 2.1.4). A snow saw is useful forcutting the test column.
2.8.4 Procedure1. Expose a fresh pit wall by cutting back about 20 cm from the wall of a full snow profile or test profile.2. Remove any very soft snow (fist hardness) or soft snow (four finger hardness) from the surface of the areawhere the test is to be carried out.3. On the snow surface mark a cross-section of the column to be cut, measuring 25 cm across the slope and 35 cm upslope.4. Cut a chimney wide enough to allow the insertion of the saw (or other cutting tool) on one side of the column and a narrow cut on the other side.5. Make a vertical cut at the back of the column and leave the cutting tool (saw) at the bottom for depth identification. The back-cut should be 0.7 m deep maximum and end in medium hard to hard snow if possible. If necessary, remove a wedge of snow near the surface at the top of the back-cut so that the shovel bend fits cleanly (see Figure 7).6. Carefully insert the shovel into the back-cut. Hold the shovel with both hands and apply a pull force in direction of the slope.7. When a clean shear fracture occurs in the column above the low end of the back-cut, mark the level of the failure plane on the rear (standing) wall of the back-cut.8. When a clean shear or irregular fracture occurs in the column at the low end of the back-cut, or when no fracture occurs, remove the column above the bottom of the back-cut and repeat steps 5 to 7 on the remaining column below.9. Repeat the test on a second column with the edge of the shovel 0.1 m to 0.2 m above the suspected weak layer.10. Measure and record the depth of the failure planes if they were equal in both tests. Repeat steps 3 to 8 if the failure planes were not at the same depth in both tests.11. If no fracture occurs, tilt the column and tap.12. Use the following chart to determine the approximate effort necessary to shear the snow as shown; recordresults.13. Observe, classify and record crystal shape and size at the failure planes (crystal samples are often best obtained from the underside of the sheared block).2.8.5 ResultsRate each fracture according to the following table:TermDescriptionEquivalent shear strength (N/m2)Data codeVery easyFractures during cutting or insertion of shovel.< 100STVEasyFractures with minimum pressure.100 - 1000STEModerateFractures with moderate pressure.1000 - 2500STMHardFractures with firm sustained pressure.2500 - 4000STHNo fractureNo shear fractures observed.STNFracture characterCharacterize the fracture according to Section 2.13.2.8.6 RecordingRecord results according to Section 2.13.3.
2.8.7 LimitationsThe primary objective of the shovel shear test is to identify the location of weak layers. The ratings of effort are subjective and depend on the strength and stiffness of the slab, on the size, shape, length of the shovel, and the length of the shovel handle.This test does not usually produce useful results in layers close to the snow surface. Soft snow near the surface is better tested with the tilt board and shear frame test (refer to Section 2.6).2.8.8 Test ConfigurationFigure 7 Shovel shear test technique and column dimensions.2.9 Compression test2.9.1 ObjectiveThe compression test was first used by Parks Canada Wardens working in the Canadian Rockies in the 1970s. The following procedure was developed by the University of Calgary avalanche research project in the late 1990s. Similar tests have been developed elsewhere.This test identifies weak snowpack layers and is most effective at finding weak layers near the snow surface. Manual taps applied to a shovel blade placed on top of a snow column cause weak layers within the column to fracture. These fractures can be seen on the smooth walls of the column. The test can be performed on level or sloping terrain.The objectives of the compression test are to locate weak layers in the upper snowpack (approximately 1 m) and provide an indication of their triggering potential on nearby slopes with similar snowpack conditions.2.9.2 Site selectionSelect a safe site that has undisturbed snow and is representative of the slopes of interest.
2.9.3 EquipmentThe equipment required is the same for test snow profiles (refer to Section 2.1.4). A snow saw is useful forcutting the test column.2.9.4 Procedure1. Isolate a 30 cm x 30 cm column of snow deep enough to expose potential weak layers on the smooth walls of the column. The uphill dimension is measured slope-parallel. A depth of 100-120 cm is usually sufficient since the compression test rarely produces fractures in deeper weak layers. Also, taller columns tend to wobble during tapping, potentially producing misleading results for deep weak layers.2. Rate any fractures that occur while isolating the column as very easy (CTV).3. Place a shovel blade on top of the column. Tap 10 times with fingertips, moving hand from wrist, and rateany fractures as easy (CTE).4. If the snow surface slopes, remove a wedge of snow to level the top of the column.5. If, during tapping, the upper part of the column slides off or no longer “evenly” supports further tapping on the column, remove the damaged part of the column, level the new top of the column and continue tapping.6. Do not remove the portion of the column above a fractured weak layer, provided that it evenly supports further tapping, since further tapping may cause fractures in shallower weak layers.7. Tap 10 times with the fingertips or knuckles moving forearm from the elbow, and rate any fracture as moderate (CTM). While moderate taps should be harder than easy taps, they should not be as hard as one can reasonably tap with the knuckles.8. Finally, hit the shovel blade moving arm from the shoulder 10 times with open hand or fist and rate any fractures as hard (CTH). If the moderate taps were too hard, the operator will often try to hit the shovel with even more force for the hard taps - and may hurt his or her hand.9. Rate any identified weak layers that did not fracture as no fracture (CTN).2.9.5 ResultsScore each fracture according to the following table:TermDescriptionData codeVery easyFractures during cutting.CTVEasyFractures before 10 light taps using fingertips only.CTEModerateFractures before 10 moderate taps from elbow using fingertips or knuckles.CTMHardFractures before 10 firm taps from whole arm using palm or fist.CTHNo fractureDoes not fracture.CTNFracture characterCharacterize the fracture according to Section 2.11.2.9.6 RecordingRecord results according to Section 2.13.3. The number of taps that caused fracture can be recorded in addition to the data code.2.9.7 LimitationsThe compression test may not produce useful results for weak layers that are very close to the snow surface. Deeper weak layers are generally less sensitive to the taps on the shovel, resulting in higher ratings.
2.9.8 Test ConfigurationFigure 8 Compression test and deep tap test technique and column dimensions.2.10 Deep tap test2.10.1 ObjectiveThe primary objective of the deep tap test is to determine the fracture character of a weak layer that is too deep to fracture consistently in the compression test. In addition, it is possible to observe the tapping force required for fracture to occur.2.10.2 Site selectionSelect a safe site that has undisturbed snow and is representative of the slopes of interest.2.10.3 EquipmentThe equipment required is the same for test snow profiles (refer to Section 2.1.4). A snow saw is useful forcutting the test column.2.10.4 Procedure1. Using a profile or other means, identify a weak snowpack layer that is overlain by 1F or harder snow andwhich is too deep to fracture consistently in the compression test.2. Prepare a 30 cm by 30 cm column as for a compression test (note that the same column can be used after a compression test of the upper layers, provided the compression test did not disturb the target weak layer). To reduce the likelihood of fractures in weak layers below the target layer, such as depth hoar at the base of the snowpack, it may be advantageous not to cut the back wall more than a few centimetres below the target weak layer.3. Level the column such that only 15 cm of snow (measured at the back of the sidewall) remains above the target weak layer.4. Place the shovel blade (facing up or facing down) on top of the column. Apply 10 light, 10 moderate and then 10 hard taps as for a compression test.
2.10.5 ResultsScore each fracture according to the following table:TermDescriptionData codeVery easyFractures during cutting.DTVEasyFractures before 10 light taps using finger tips only.DTEModerateFractures before 10 moderate taps from elbow using finger tips.DTMHardFractures before 10 firm taps from whole arm using palm or fist.DTHNo fractureDoes not fracture.DTNFracture characterCharacterize the fracture according to Section 2.11.2.10.6 RecordingRecord according to Section 2.13.3.2.10.7 LimitationsWhile very effective for testing deeper weak layers, the number of taps required to initiate failure in the deep tap test has never been correlated with skier-triggering or avalanche activity on adjacent slopes. However, the fracture character observations have been verified (van Herwijnen, 2005) and may be interpreted as in the compression test.2.10.8 Test ConfigurationRefer to Figure 8 for deep tap test technique and column dimensions.2.11 Extended column test2.11.1 ObjectiveThe extended column test is a snowpack test that aims to indicate the propensity (tendency) of slab and weak layer combinations in the upper portion of the snowpack (< 1m deep) to propagate a fracture.2.11.2 Site selectionSelect a safe site that has undisturbed snow and is representative of the slopes of interest.2.11.3 EquipmentThe equipment required is the same for test snow profiles, (refer to Section 2.1.4). Eight metres of 4 to 7 mm cord with overhand knots tied every 20 or 30 cm can be used to cut the upper wall provided no hard crusts are encountered. Long snow saws are useful to cut hard crusts. A cord with two collapsible probes can be used to cut the upper wall and both sides of the column at the same time.
2.11.4 Procedure1. Isolate a column of snow 90 cm across the slope, 30 cm up the slope, and deep enough to expose potentialweak layers. Depth should not exceed 100 cm since the loading steps rarely affect deeper layers.2. Rate any fractures that cross the entire column while isolating it as ECTPV.3. If the snow surface is hard and inclined, remove a wedge of snow to level the top of the column at one edge.4. Place the shovel blade on one side of the column and apply 10 light, 10 moderate and then 10 hard taps as for a compression test (Section 2.9).2.11.5 ResultsScore each fracture according to the following table:Data codeObserved resultsECTPVFracture propagates across the entire column during isolation.ECTP##Fracture propagates across the entire column on the ## tap OR fracture observed on the ## tap and propagates across the column on the ## + 1 tap.ECTN##Fracture observed on the ## tap, but does not propagate across the entire column on either the ## or the ##+1 tap.*ECTXNo fracture observed during the test.Note:	* Fracture either propagates across only part of the column (observed commonly), or it takes more than one additional loading step to propagate across the entire column (observed relatively rarely).2.11.6 RecordingRecord test results according to the following:<data code with ## taps><reference direction> <location in profile> <”on” layer characteristics> <comments>Indicate the reference direction to locate the fracture position (down = from surface; up = from ground). Down is the default direction (i.e. from the snow surface), however, there may be situations where measuring up from the ground is more convenient.Example 1: An extended column test fractures across the entire column on the 13th tap. The column releases on a layer of 6 to 10 mm depth hoar that is 35 cm above the ground and was buried on November 22.Record as: ECTP13 up 35 on DH 6.0–10.0 Nov. 22Example 2: During testing a slab fracture occurs, which propagates into the weak layer then across the remainder of the column on the 25th tap. The column releases on a layer of 8 mm surface hoar that is 65 cm deep and was buried on February 14th.Record as: ECTN25 down 65 on SH 8.0 Feb. 14 WL fracture initiated from slab fracture2.11.7 LimitationsThe extended column test is not a good tool to assess weaknesses in soft (F+ or less) upper layers of the snowpack or in mid-storm shear layers. In these cases the shovel edge tends to cut those soft layers. It is not a good tool to asses fracture propagation propensity on a weak layer deeper than approximately 80 to 100 cm.
2.11.8 Test ConfigurationFigure 9 Extended column test setup.2.12 Propagation saw test2.12.1 ObjectiveThe propagation saw test is a snowpack test that aims to indicate the propensity (tendency) of a pre-identifiedslab and weak layer combination to propagate a fracture.2.12.2 Site selectionSelect a safe slope or flat area that has undisturbed snow and is representative of the slopes of interest.2.12.3 EquipmentThe equipment required is the same for test snow profiles, (refer to Section 2.1.4). Eight metres of 4 to 7 mm cord with overhand knots tied every 20 or 30 cm can be used to cut the upper wall provided no hard crusts are encountered. Long snow saws are useful to cut hard crusts. A cord with two collapsible probes can be used to cut the upper wall and both sides of the column at the same time. The blade of the snow saw should be at least 35 cm long and no more that 2 mm thick.2.12.4 Procedure1. Isolate a column 30 cm across the slope and 100 cm up the slope when the weak layer is less than 100 cm deep. When the weak layer is >100 cm deep the column length should equal the weak layer depth in the upslope direction. The column should be isolated to a depth below the layer being tested.2. To identify the weak layer clearly, mark the weak layer with a glove, a brush, or a crystal card along the exposed column wall.
3. Drag the blunt edge of the saw upslope through the weak layer at a 10-20 cm/s speed until the fracture propagates (jumps) ahead of the saw, at which point stop dragging the saw cutting and mark the spot along the layer where propagation began.4. After observations are complete, remove the column and check that the saw scored the weak layer in the wall behind the test column. If the saw deviated from the weak layer, the test should be repeated.2.12.5 ResultsOnce the fracture propagates ahead of the saw, one of three results can be observed as noted in the chart below.Observed ResultDescriptionData codePropagation to endThe fracture propagates in front of the saw uninterrupted to the end of column.EndSlab fractureThe fracture propagates in front of the saw until it is interrupted and stops at a slope-normal slab fracture that forms through the overlying slab.SFSelf-arrestThe fracture propagates in front of the saw but self-arrests somewhere along the weak layer before reaching the end of the column.Arr2.12.6 RecordingRecord test results according to the following:<”PST” x/y> <fracture arrest condition> <reference direction> <location in profile> <”on” layercharacteristics> <comments>where x is the length of the saw cut when propagation starts, y is the column length up the slope.Indicate the reference direction to locate the fracture position (down = from surface; up = from ground). Down is the default direction (i.e. from the snow surface), however, there may be situations where measuring up from the ground is more convenient.Example: A propagation saw test fractures across the entire column after cutting 23 cm. The column releases on a layer of 6-10 mm depth hoar that is 135 cm below the snow surface and was buried on November 22.Record as: PST 23/135 End down 135 on DH 6.0–10.0 Nov. 222.12.7 LimitationsThe propagation saw test tends to give false-stable results for soft shallow slabs and when the weak layer is too difficult to cut with the saw’s blunt edge. Pre-selecting and identifying the layer of concern for testing can be challenging. The cut distance (x) may depend on the slope angle.
2.12.8 Test ConfigurationFigure 10 Schematic showing the test column (a) and the observable results of propagation to end (b), slab fracture (c), and self arrest (d).2.13 Fracture characterObserving fracture character in stability tests can improve interpretation with respect to stability (van Herwijnen, 2005; van Herwijnen and Jamieson, 2004; Johnson and Birkeland, 2002). Experience suggests that fracture character may be observed in shovel shear tests (Section 2.8), compression tests (Section 2.9), deep tap tests (Section 2.10) and other tests which load a small column of snow until a fracture appears.Three major classes of fractures are identified: sudden fractures, resistant fractures and breaks. The major classes are used to qualify and communicate test results that are significant for avalanche forecasting when test conditions will not allow direct observation of the fracture character subclasses.2.13.1 ProcedureFracture character is best observed in tests performed on a small isolated column of snow where the objective is to load the column until a fracture (or no fracture) occurs. Typical small columns are less then 50 cm x 50 cm in cross-section.The front face and side walls of the test column should be as smooth as possible. The observer should be positioned in such a way that one side wall and the entire front face of the test column can be observed. Attention should be focused on weak layers or interfaces identified in a profile or previous snowpack tests as likely to fracture.For tests on low-angled terrain that produced planar fractures, it may be useful to slide the two fracture surfaces across one another by carefully grasping the two sides of the block and pulling while noting the resistance.
2.13.2 ObservationsUse the following table to characterize the fracture:Major classData codeSub classData codeFracture characteristicsSudden(pops and drops)SDNSudden planar (pop, clean and fast fracture)SPA thin planar* fracture suddenly crosses column in one loading step AND the block slides easily** on the weak layer.Sudden collapse(drop)SCFracture crosses the column with a single loading step and is associated with a noticeable collapse of the weak layer.Resistant(others)RESProgressive compression (step by step “squashing” of a layer)PCA fracture of noticeable thickness (non- planar fractures often greater than 1 cm), which usually crosses the column with a single loading step, followed by step-by-step compression of the layer with subsequent loading steps.Resistant planarRPPlanar or mostly planar fracture that requires more than one loading step to cross column and/or the block does NOT slide easily** on the weak layer.Break( others)BRKNon-planar breakBRKNon-planar, irregular fracture.Note:	* “Planar” based on straight fracture lines on front and side walls of column.** Block slides off column on steep slopes. On low-angle slopes, hold sides of the block and noteresistance to sliding.2.13.3 RecordingRecord results of a test as follows:<data code> <(fracture character)> <reference point> <location in profile> <”on” layer characteristics (form,size, date of burial if known)> <comments> Example: CTM 17 (SC) down 34 on SH 8.0 Jan 22Indicate reference point for the fracture position (down = from snow surface or up = from ground). The snow surface is the default reference point for measuring fracture location. Measure down from the snow surface and record location of fracture in the profile. When location of the fracture is measured up from the ground, record reference point as up and indicate this clearly in the comments.2.13.4 ExamplesIf multiple tests at the same site produce results on the same layer, record results as follows:<data code #1> <(fracture character #1)>, <data code #2> <(fracture character #2)>, <data code #3><(fracture character #3)>, etc. <reference point> <location in profile> <”on” layer characteristics (form, size,date of burial if known)> <comments>

Additional loading steps continue to squash soft snow layer.Second test - Column fractures at 22 cm on the seventh tap from the wrist (CTE 7). There is squashing of at least part of a soft snow layer but there is no displacement of the block. Additional loading steps continue to squash soft snow layer.Recording: CTE 3 (PC), 7 (PC) down 22 on PP 4.02.14 Snowpack summary2.14.1 ObjectivesSnowpack summaries provide a clear and concise overview of snowpack conditions to assist stability and hazard analysis and forecasting for the operational region. The objective of such a summary is to organize and reduce data.Snowpack summary parameters are different from snowpack observation parameters in that they are not recorded at a specific location and time but are a general characterization of the range of conditionsencountered in a broader geographical area during the day. This not only includes average conditions but also potential anomalies and outliers.2.14.2 FrequencySummaries are generally done once a day, at the end of the day.2.14.3 ProcedureThe following parameters should be recorded in a snowpack summary:DateRecord date as described in Section 2.1.5.Time periodThe time range during which snowpack observations were made.
Locations and elevation rangeThe locations and elevation range where snowpack observations were made. Many operations will record a drainage as a single location.Percent of area observedThe area observed recorded as a percentage of the entire operational region.Snow profileSummarize relevant measurements as described in Section 2.2.4 for a test profile. This includes slabproperties, weak layer attributes, temperature gradients, etc.Stability testsCharacterize stability test results as described in Section 2.7.6 for rutschblock tests and Section 2.13.3 for small-column stability tests.CommentsMake any additional comments as required. These may include notes on signs of instability, settlement, andthe effects of wind, air temperature and solar radiation.
3. Avalanche observations3.1 ObjectivesObservations and records of avalanche occurrences have the following applications:• Information about avalanche occurrences and non-occurrences is used in association with other observations in evaluating snow stability.• Observations identify areas where avalanches have released earlier in the winter; snow stability may vary between these sites and undisturbed slopes.• Avalanche observation data are essential when protective works and facilities are planned, when the effectiveness of control measures is assessed, and when forecasting models are developed by correlating past weather and snow conditions with avalanche occurrences.All avalanches that are significant to an operation should be recorded. Noting the non-occurrence ofavalanches is important for snow stability evaluation.3.2 Identification of avalanche pathsAvalanche paths should be identified by a key name, number, aspect or a similar identifier which should be referred to on lists, maps or photographs. At roads, railway lines and power lines it is convenient to refer to avalanche paths by the running kilometre.Avalanche starting zones that can produce avalanches independently are often divided into sub-zones.Separate targets for explosive control may be identified within each starting zone.3.3 Observations of individual avalanchesThe following section describes techniques used to classify individual avalanches. These guidelines shouldbe followed for all significant events.Section 3.5 describes a classification system which can be used to report groups of similar events or tosummarize the level of avalanche activity in a particular area.A set of core observations is best recorded on the left-hand page of the field-book (see Figures 12 and 13) oron photographs. The right-hand page may be used for comments and additional observations.3.3.1 DateRecord year, month and day of the avalanche occurrence, yyyy-mm-dd (i.e. December 15, 2001, is noted as 2001-12-05).3.3.2 TimeRecord the observation time on a 24-hour clock (avoid spaces, colons, etc.) i.e. 5:10 p.m. is noted as 1710.Use local time (e.g. Pacific or Mountain time). Operations that overlap time zones should standardize to onetime.Estimate and record the age (in hours) of the avalanche.If the avalanche release was witnessed then the observation time is the time of occurrence and the age will be 0 hours.
Valid entries are 0, 0.5, or 1 to 99 hours. Zero indicates that the time is precisely known.Note:	+/- 0 is used when the time of occurrence is precisely known.3.3.3 Area and pathEnter the name of the operation or avalanche area where the avalanche path is located.Note:	It is not necessary to note the area in every entry of a field notebook if that book is not taken from area to area.Enter the identifier (name or number) of the avalanche path.Some road operations may name their paths by the running kilometre. In this case two decimal places may be used to identify paths within a whole kilometre.3.3.4 AspectUse eight cardinal points of compass to specify the avalanche’s central aspect in the starting zone.3.3.5 InclineRecord the estimated incline of the starting zone. Add “M” if measured.3.3.6 SizeEstimate the destructive potential of the avalanche from the deposited snow, and assign a size number. Imagine that the objects on the following list (people, cars, trees) were located in the track or at the beginning of the runout zone and estimate the harm the avalanche could have caused.Size anddata codeDestructive potentialTypicalmass  Typical path lengthTypical impact pressure1Relatively harmless to people.<10 t10 m1 kPa2Could bury, injure, or kill a person.102 t100 m10 kPa3Could bury and destroy a car, damage a truck, destroy a wood-frame house or break a few trees.103 t1,000 m100 kPa4Could destroy a railway car, large truck, several buildings or a forest area of approximately 4 hectares.104 t2,000 m500 kPa5Largest snow avalanche known. Could destroy a village or a forest area of approximately 40 hectares.105 t3,000 m1,000 kPaNote:	Size 1 is the minimum size rating. In general, half sizes are not defined, but may be used by experienced practitioners for avalanches which are midway between defined avalanche size classes (i.e. size 2.5).The destructive potential of avalanches is a function of their mass, speed and density as well as the length and cross-section of the avalanche path.Typical impact pressures for each size number were given by McClung and Schaerer (1981).The number “0” may be used to indicate no release of an avalanche following the application of control measures.
3.3.7 Type of snow failureRecord the type of snow failure.Symbol anddata codeFailure typeSSlab avalancheLLoose-snow avalancheLSLoose-snow + slabCCornice fallCSCornice fall + slabIIce fallISIce fall + slabNote:	Record the slab hardness if observed. Hardness can be measured using the hand hardness test (i.e. 1F, P, etc.) in the starting zone or from the deposit in the runout zone, where the slab is still recognizable.3.3.8 Liquid water contentLiquid water content in starting zoneDetermine the liquid water content of the avalanche snow in the starting zone at the time of failure.Symbol anddata codeLiquid water content in the avalanche starting zoneDDry snowMMoist snowWWet snowLiquid water content of depositDetermine liquid water content of the avalanche snow at the time and location of the deposit.Symbol anddata codeLiquid water content of depositDDry snowMMoist snowWWet snow
3.3.9 TerminusDescribe the location of the tip of the avalanche deposit with a code letter.Symbol anddata codeTerminus for long pathsSZAvalanche stopped in starting zone.TKAvalanche stopped in track.TRAvalanche stopped at top part of runout zone.MRAvalanche stopped in middle part of runout zone.BRAvalanche stopped in bottom part of runout zone.Terminus for short pathsTPAvalanche stopped near top part of path.MPAvalanche stopped near middle part of path.BPAvalanche stopped near bottom part of path.Note:	The codes TP, MP and BP are applicable for short paths where the starting zone, track and runout zone cannot be easily separated.Operations that have avalanche paths with well-defined features may apply additional codes. For example:Symbol anddata codeTerminus1FAvalanche stopped on top 1/4 of fan.2FAvalanche stopped halfway down fan.3FAvalanche stopped 3/4 of way down fan.3.3.10 TriggerIndicate the cause of avalanche release with a basic code letter and, where possible, a modifier. Operations may devise other trigger subclasses that apply to their specific conditions in consultation with the CAA.Symbol anddata codeCause of avalanche releaseNNatural triggersXExplosivesSSkier or snowboarderMSnowmobilesVOver-snow vehiclesOOther (specify in comments)

Note:	Avalanches that start when a helicopter or other aircraft flies overhead should be considered natural.A remote event is one occurring at some distance (typically > 5 m) from the probable trigger. Snow at the trigger point does not release. Specify the distance to a sympathetic and remote event (in metres).3.3.11 CommentsEnter information about damage and accidents caused by the avalanche and any other significant information. Describe weather phenomena suspected as the trigger (i.e. rising or falling temperature trend, solar effect, wind loading, wind gusts, precipitation intensity).3.4 Additional observationsAdditional observations may be selected as applicable from those listed in this section. Certain additional observations are valuable in areas where avalanches are either controlled or affect traffic and/or communication lines.For operations that control avalanches by explosives note:* Number of explosive charges* Size of charges (kg)* Target* Location of avalanche start* Sliding surfaceWhen explosives were used but no avalanche resulted or charges misfired note:* Number* Size (kg)* Target* Location of chargesFor highway, railway, mine and forestry road operations note:* Length of road buried* Average and maximum depth of snow on the road* Toe distance mass: distance of the toe of the avalanche mass from the uphill edge (fog line) of the road or railwayFor ski areas note:* Target* Location of avalanche start* Failure plane and bed surface (note the date of burial and predominant grain type where possible)* Width and thickness of slab avalanches at their crown3.4.1 Number of explosive charges/number of detonationsRecord the number (1 to 9) of projectiles or explosive charges applied to a target. Record the number (1 to 9)of confirmed detonations.Note:	The difference in the two values gives a dud count.
3.4.2 Size of explosive chargeNote the amount of explosive per charge.3.4.3 Avalanche starting locationPosition in starting zoneDescribe the location of the avalanche fracture with one of the following code letters, physical features or elevation and, when applicable, add the key for the starting sub-zone or the target.Symbol anddata codeLocation of startTAt the top of the starting zone.MIn the middle of the starting zone.BAt the bottom of the starting zone.Incline of starting zoneRecord the incline of the steepest pitch in the avalanche starting zone (excluding cliffs) averaged over afall-line distance of 20 m.3.4.4 Bed surfaceLevel of bed surfaceRecord the level of the bed surface (the layer over which a slab slides) in the snowpack.Symbol anddata codeBed surfaceSAvalanche started sliding within a layer of recent storm snow.OAvalanche released below storm snow on an old surface or within an old snow layer. Often a persistent weak layer.GAvalanche released at ground, glacial ice or firn.Note:	Storm snow is defined as all snow deposited during a recent storm.Form and age of failure planeRecord the predominant grain form observed in the failure plane (refer to Appendix D). Where possible identify the weak layer by its probable date of burial. Note the occurrence of a shear fracture that steps down to other layers in Comments.3.4.5 Slab widthIn a slab avalanche, record width (m) of the slab between the flanks near the fracture line. Add “M” whenwidth is actually measured. Observers may wish to use a hip chain to calibrate their estimates.Note:	All dimensions are assumed to be estimates unless the values are followed with the letter M (measured).
3.4.6 Slab thicknessIf practical, estimate or measure in a vertical direction, to nearest 10 cm (i.e. 10 - 30 cm), the average thickness of the slab at the fracture line. Add “M” when thickness is actually measured.3.4.7 Deposit on roadRecord in metres the length of road, railway line, ski run, power line or other facility buried in avalanche snow.Record average depth and maximum depth of avalanche mass on the road, etc., in metres and tenths of a metre. Add “M” when length and depth are measured.3.4.8 Toe distance massMeasure or estimate the distance between the uphill edge or fog line of the road, or other development, and the farthest point reached by the mass of avalanche. Negative values are used when the deposited mass failed to reach the road or facility.Note:	Some operations may also wish to document the occurrence of snow dust on the road. Dust results from the fallout of an avalanche’s powder cloud. Its main impact is on driver visibility.3.4.9 Total deposit dimensionsRecord the average width and length of the deposited avalanche snow in metres.Record the average deposit depth in metres and tenths of a metre. Add “M” after each value is measured by tape and probing.3.4.10 ElevationsWith reference to a contour map record elevation (in m ASL) of the:• Fracture line or point of failure in starting zone• Deposit in runout zone3.4.11 Length of path runSome operations may wish to record the estimated distance an avalanche ran along a slope.• Up to a distance of 300 m estimate the distance run to nearest 25 m.• Beyond a distance of 300 m estimate the distance run to nearest 100 m.3.4.12 Road / line statusTransportation operations should record the status (open or closed) of any roads or railway lines at the time when the avalanche occurred.

3.5 Multiple avalanche eventsAn operation may wish to group large numbers of similar avalanche events into one record or report, especially if that information is to be sent to a central information exchange. Grouping is achieved by allowing certain fields to hold a range of values (i.e. by specifying lower and upper bounds, separated by a dash). The report should be repeated for different types of activity (i.e. natural versus artificially released avalanches).ParameterCriteriaExamplesDateMost probable (median) date for activityas YYYY-MM-DD2016-02-12TimeDigits0900AgeDigits (±0 to 99 hours)48Area (location)Text (80 characters max.)“proposed SW recreation area”Number of occurrencesDigits or keywords acceptable1 to 99, Several (2 - 9) Numerous (10 or more)Isolated (less than 5 over a wide geographicalarea)SizeThe range of any one report should belimited to 1? size classes1.5 - 3.0TriggerKey letter (do not mix natural andartificial triggers in this report)Xe, UTypeKey letter (do not mix slab and loose)S, L, UAspect(of starting zone)Keyword, 1 or a combination of the 8cardinal points of the compassAll, W, SW-NWElevation(at fracture)600 m max. range1800 - 2400 mIncline (at fracture)20 degree max. range32 - 42 degreeLevel of bedsurfaceKey letter (do not mix storm snow, oldsnow and ground)S, O, G or UGrain form atfailure planeGrain form abbreviation(Fierz, et al., in press)SHAge of failure planeProbable date of burial14 Jan.Slab widthRange (m)60 - 110 mSlab thicknessRange (cm)10 - 30 cmLength of path runRange (m)500 - 1500 mCommentsMax. of 5 lines by 80 characters per lineNote: Significant avalanches (larger than size 3), and events involving incident, damage or injury should not be described in this method.

3.6 Avalanche summary3.6.1 ObjectivesAvalanche summaries provide a clear and concise overview of avalanche conditions to assist stability and hazard analysis and forecasting for the operational region. The objective of such a summary is to organize and reduce data.Avalanche summary parameters are different from avalanche observation parameters in that they are not recorded at a specific location and time but are a general characterization of the range of conditionsencountered in a broader geographical area during the day. This not only includes average conditions but also potential anomalies and outliers.3.6.2 FrequencySummaries are generally done once a day, after the field day is completed.3.6.3 ProcedureThe following basic avalanche observations should be recorded in an avalanche summary.Locations and elevation rangeLocations and elevation range where avalanche observations were made. Many operations will record a drainage as a single location.Percent of area observedThe area observed recorded as a percentage of the entire operational region.Date of occurrenceThe occurrence date as outlined in Section 3.3.1. If the actual date is unknown, estimate based on previous weather, condition of the crown and deposit, etc.Time periodThe time range during which the avalanche(s) were observed and the age range of the avalanches as outlined in Section 3.3.2.NumberThe number of avalanches of each type and trigger that involved each failure plane and occurred on each date.SizeThe typical size of the avalanches observed and the maximum size observed, as described in Section 3.3.6, for each type, trigger, failure plane and occurrence date.TriggerRecord the cause of avalanche release as outlined in Section 3.3.10.TypeRecord the type of snow failure as described in Section 3.3.7.
InclineThe average or range of starting zone inclines for each type, trigger and occurrence date.AspectThe average or range of starting zone aspects for each type, trigger, failure plane and occurrence date.ElevationThe average or range of starting zone elevations for each type, trigger, failure plane and occurrence date.DepthThe average or range of slab thickness values for slab, loose snow + slab, cornice fall + slab or ice fall + slab avalanches and for each trigger, failure plane and occurrence date.WidthThe average or range of slab width values for slab, loose snow + slab, cornice fall + slab or ice fall + slab avalanches and for each trigger, failure plane and occurrence date.LengthThe average or range of length of path run values, as described in Section 3.4.11, for each type, trigger, failure plane and occurrence date.Failure planeRecord the predominant grain form and level in the snowpack of the failure plane as described in Section 3.4.4.CommentsMake any additional comments as required. These may include notes on whumpfs, fracture propagation, slab properties and weak layer attributes.3.7 RecordingAlways record the names (initials are fine) of observers with the primary observer listed first. Use a tilde (~) in the notebook when no observation was made. Code as “U” if the observation was attempted but no reliable value could be ascertained (i.e. when an old avalanche is observed and the trigger or type of snow failure cannot be discerned). Do not leave blanks. Only write “0” when the reading is zero (i.e. when the length of road, railway line or ski run buried by the avalanche is zero).
Appendix AWeather observation sites and proceduresMeasurements of precipitation, temperature, wind and the characteristics of the snowpack are dependent on the observation site. It is usually impossible to find a place that would both duplicate the conditions in the avalanche starting zones and be safe and accessible for regular daily observations, so one must be satisfied by choosing a site that provides a good correlation between measurements and snow stability. This means that observational data are only indices of conditions in avalanche paths.Site selection requires knowledge of the area and skill in meeting contradictory needs. Sometimes parallel observations may be required in several possible locations for one winter before a permanent site is chosen, or a site may have to be abandoned after yielding unsatisfactory correlations with avalanche occurrences.Observation sites for precipitation and those for wind speed are incompatible. Data on precipitation, often the most important parameter, should be collected at a location sheltered from the wind, whereas wind observations require an exposed site. For practical reasons, temperature observations are usually carried out together with precipitation measurements, but it is preferable to supplement these data with temperature observations at a wind station.The following guidelines apply to the selection of observation sites.A.1 Precipitation, snowpack and temperature study plotsThe observation site should be as close as possible to avalanche starting zones.The location should be sheltered from the wind. Sites that minimize snow drifting should be selected if wind cannot be avoided. This is often the case for locations above treeline.Precipitation gauges located at windy sites can seriously underestimate the actual precipitation amount. Gauge catch can be improved by up to 20% at such sites by fitting an Alter or Nipher shield, or a similar device around the gauge orifice.The Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) specify ideal distances from vertical obstructions such as trees and buildings. A preferred distance is about two times the height for precipitation gauges and Stevenson screens.In high snowfall areas Stevenson screens should be fitted to an adjustable tower and kept 1.2 to 1.4 m above the snow surface. The screen door should open to the north to prevent insolation of the temperature sensors. If electronic sensors are not housed in a Stevenson screen then they must be fitted with radiation shields that allow for good ventilation. A louvered baffle system is commonly used.The study plot should be on level ground with a smooth surface; grass cover is preferred. The ground should be drained.The access should be convenient and safe under all weather conditions. Study plots for regular daily snow and weather observations should be close to the operation’s headquarters.A fence and signs should be erected to prevent trespassing. Animal-proof fences are recommended for areas where wildlife might interfere with instrumentation.
A.2 Wind stationsThe main requirement for wind stations is a good correlation between the observed winds and speeds and directions in the avalanche starting zones. It may be advantageous to position a wind station on a ridge lower than the mountain peaks, but close to the avalanche starting zone. Identify the potential for snowdrift before placing wind stations.Anemometers should be located atop a vibration-free 10 m tower. MSC specify that the distance from vertical obstructions such as trees and buildings should preferably be about 10 times the height for anemometers.Ideally, there should be no obstructions within a 100 m radius of the anemometer (this is difficult to achieve).The station must be accessible in the winter either by foot, snowmobile or helicopter for occasional maintenance of equipment. Rime ice accretion is a common problem.A.3 Meteorological instruments procedures (Source: AES MANOBS, 1977)A.3.1 Reading thermometersThe main steps in reading a thermometer are:1. Stand as far from the thermometer as is consistent with accurate reading, to prevent body heat fromaffecting the thermometer.2. Ensure that line of sight from the eye to top of the liquid column makes a 90 degree angle with the thermometer tube, to avoid an error due to parallax. Read thermometer to nearest tenth of a degree.3. Recheck reading to ensure that it was not misread by 5 or 10 degrees.A.3.2 Resetting maximum and minimum thermometersReset the maximum thermometer after each standard observation. To reset, remove thermometer from its supports, grasp it firmly at the end opposite the bulb and hold it bulb down. Allow the mercury to come into contact with the constriction before starting the reset motion. Briskly swing the thermometer, through an arc that prevents the bulb from rising above the horizontal. This is to prevent damage to the thermometer.Note:	The maximum thermometer is positioned almost horizontally in the Stevenson Screen. Its bulb should be slightly lower than the opposite end.Reset the minimum thermometer after each standard observation. To reset, remove the bulb end from its support and raise it until the index slides down and rests against the meniscus. Return the bulb end carefully to its support.Check maximum and minimum thermometer readings after each reset. Check for occurrence of breaks or bubbles in the column and ensure that thermometer readings are representative of ambient temperature.Note:	Maximum thermometers manufactured by JUMO may appear to have a short break in the mercury column in the area of the constriction. This break is caused by a small glass rod inside the bore of the thermometer. Do not attempt to re-unite the column in this area after the thermometer has been reset to the ambient air temperature.
A.3.3 Thermograph procedure and calibrationMany stations are equipped with thermographs for a continuous record of temperature against time. Although the thermograph is not regarded as a primary standard, it may be used as a reference for temperature data (maximum and minimum for standard observations). When temperature data are not available from maximum or minimum thermometers the thermograph may be used to obtain temperatures provided that the following procedures are observed.1. The thermograph is housed in a thermometer shelter located no farther than necessary from the one which contains the thermometers. It may be possible in some cases to house the thermograph and the thermometer in the same shelter.2. At the time of each chart change:• Adjust thermograph so that the temperature indicated at the start of the trace on the new chart agrees with the present temperature at the time of chart change.• Enter the present temperature to the nearest degree just above the end of the temperature trace on the chart just completed.3. At each standard observation make a time checkmark across the trace by raising and lowering the pen the width of two printed temperature intervals.4. Adjust the thermograph promptly if at any time the recorder trace is in error by more than 1.5 oC.A.3.4 Hygrograph calibrationCalibrate the hygrograph at least twice each winter, at the start of the season and again mid-season. Use a wet and dry bulb psychrometer (either an Assman or sling type) and appropriate tables for the site’s elevation to determine the relative humidity. Ideally, calibrate the hygrograph at a time when the air temperature is close to or above freezing.Note:	Electronic humidity sensors should also be calibrated with a psychrometer. Electronic sensors often suffer long-term degradation and drift.
         Appendix B Reporting avalanche incidentsB.1 ObjectiveThe objective of reporting avalanche accidents and damage is to collect data about the nature and extent of avalanche hazards in Canada. Summaries of the reports will draw attention to avalanche hazards and assist in the development of risk reduction measures. Reports in this long-term data set are also used to help identify trends in avalanche incidents and for educational purposes.Individual reports will be treated confidentially and results made public in summary form only. Interesting cases may be included in publications of avalanche incident case histories with the agreement of the parties involved. Recording reporter and victim names and contact information is encouraged but not required.B.2 Reporting formsForms are available for recording avalanche incidents and damage. Any person who wishes to report an avalanche incident can use these forms. Filing reports on-line is encouraged.The short form is designed for reporting the fact that people or objects had an encounter with avalanches. This report should be submitted every time people are involved in an avalanche or property is damaged.The detailed report can be used as a template for an incident investigation. This report should be completed when an avalanche caused a fatality, serious injury, property damage in excess of CND$10,000, or when an incident has high educational value. It may be useful as a check list when operations wish to describe an incident and rescue work in greater detail.B.3 Filing of reportsFatal incidents should always be reported to the RCMP.These forms as well as procedures for submitting avalanche incidents in Canada are currently under revision. The best place to report non-fatal recreational incidents is Avalanche Canada’s Mountain Information Network at www.avalanche.ca.The best place to report non-fatal professional incidents is the InfoEx.For serious incidents and fatalities, please contact the Canadian Avalanche Association (for professional incidents) or Avalanche Canada (for recreational incidents) for the latest forms and submission procedures.
B.4 DefinitionsThe following definitions are provided for reporting incidents with the intent of delineating between different rescue scenarios.Write “N/Av” if the information is not available or “N/App” if not applicable when completing reports.A person is caught if they are touched and adversely affected by the avalanche. People performing slope cuts are generally not considered caught in the resulting avalanche unless they are carried down the slope.For people who are caught, specify the degree of burial according to the following:1. A person is not buried if they are on the surface, their airway is not impaired and they are free to move when the avalanche stops.2. A person is partially buried – not critical if part of their body or clothing is visible and their breathing is not impaired by the snow when the avalanche stops. This requires that the person’s head is above the snow surface and their airway is not obstructed.3. A person is partially buried – critical if part of their body, clothing or attached equipment is visible but their breathing is impaired by the snow when the avalanche stops. Examples include situations wherea person’s head is buried below the surface, or a person’s head is above the surface but their airway is plugged by snow. A person not buried but suffering from impaired breathing (i.e. airway plugged with snow) is also classified partially buried – critical. For triage purposes, people who are partially buried – critical can be prioritized as U1 (first priority).4. A person is completely buried if they are completely beneath the snow surface when the avalanche stops. For triage purposes, people who are completely buried can be prioritized according to the following:a) U2 (second priority)• no visible surface clues: no attached equipment or body parts visible. Shallow – Medium burial 20cm – 190cm• U2-Alpha (air pocket)• U2-Zulu (no air pocket)b) U3 (third priority)• no visible surface clues: no attached equipment or body parts visible. Deep 2m+• U3-Alpha (air pocket)• U3-Zulu (no air pocket)For people that were completely buried or partially buried – critical estimate the length of time they were buried and the burial depth measured from the snow surface to their face.

Appendix CInternational system (SI) of units and expanded equationsC.1 DensityPrevious editions of these guidelines (1989 and earlier) described a measure known as specific gravity. This term is no longer used. Specific gravity of snow was non-dimensional and had a value of less than one.Previous data recorded as specific gravity may be converted by multiplying by 1000 as follows:Density (kg/m3) = Specific gravity x 1000i.e. A specific gravity value of 0.15 = 150 kg/m3.C.2 Barometric pressureBarometric pressure is expressed in kilopascals (kPa). Use the following multipliers to convert from other units.Unit  Multiplier used to convert to kilopascalsHectopascal (hPa)0.1Millibars (mb)0.1Millimetres of mercury (mmHg)0.133Inches of mercury (inHg)3.386C.3 Stress and strengthThe strength of avalanche snow ranges from about 0.1 kPa to an upper limit of 100 kPa.Unit  Multiplier used to convert to kilopascalsPascal (Pa)0.001Newtons per square metre (N/m2)0.001Grams per square centimetre (g/cm2)0.0981C.4 Impact pressuresIt is common engineering practice to specify impact pressures in tonnes per square metre (t/m2). A more precise unit is tonnes-force per square metre. Refer to Appendix A of The Avalanche Handbook, 3rd Edition, McClung and Schaerer (2006) for a discussion.Unit  Multiplier used to convert to kilopascalsTonnes per square metre (t/m2)9.81

Wind packedy
Small, broken or abraded, closely-packed particles; well sintered
RGwp	Surface layer;dry snow
Packing and fragmentation of wind trans- ported snow particles that round off by in- teraction with each other in the saltation layer. Evolves into either a hard but usually breakable wind crust or a thicker wind slab. (see notes)
Hardness increases with wind speed, decreasing particle size and moderate temperature
High number of contact points and small size causes rapid strength increase through sintering
    Faceted rounded particlesz
Rounded, usually elongated particles with developing fac- ets
RGxf	Within snowpack; dry snow
Growth regime changes if mean excess va- pour density is larger than critical value for kinetic growth. Accordingly, this transi- tional form develops facets as temperature gradient increases
Grains are changing in response to an increasing temperature gradient
Reduction in number of bonds may decrease strength
Notes: – Both wind crusts and wind slabs are layers of small, broken or abraded, closely packed and well-sintered particles. The former are thin irregular layers whereas the latter are thicker, often dense layers, usually found on lee slopes.  Both types of layers can be represented either as sub-class RGwp or as RGsr along with proper grain size, hardness and/or density. – If the grains are smaller than about 1 mm, an observer will need to consider the process at work to differentiate RGxf from FCxr.References: [1] Colbeck, 1997

DHla	Within the snowpack; dry snow

Rounding depth hoarH
Hollow skeleton type crystals with rounding of sharp edges, corners, and striations
DHxr	Within the snowpack; dry snow
Trend to a form reducing its specific sur- face area; corners and edges of the crystals are rounding off; faces may loose their re- lief, i.e., striations and steps disappear slowly. This process effects all subclasses of depth hoar
Grains are rounding off in re- sponse to a decreasing temperature gradient
May regain strength
Notes: – DH and FC crystals may also grow in snow with density larger than about 300 kg m-3 such as found in polar snow cover or wind slabs. These may then be termed ‘hard’ or ‘indurated’ depth hoar [3].

Surface Hoar	SH
Surface hoar crystalsIg
Striated, usually flat crystals; sometimes needle-like
SHsu	Usually on cold snow surface relative to air temperature; sometimes on freely exposed ob- jects above the surface (see notes)
Rapid kinetic growth of crystals at the snow surface by rapid transfer of water va- pour from the atmosphere toward the snow surface; snow surface cooled to below am- bient temperature by radiative cooling
Both, increased cooling of the snow surface below air tempera- ture as well as increasing relative humidity of the air cause growth rate to increase.In high water vapour gradient fields, e.g., near creeks, large feathery crystals may develop
Fragile, extremely low shear strength; strength may remain low for ex- tended periods when buried in cold dry snow
Cavity or crevasse hoarJ
Striated, planar or hollow skeleton type crystals grown in cavities; orientation often random
SHcv	Cavity hoar is found in large voids in the snow, e.g., in the vi- cinity of tree trunks, buried bushes [1]Crevasse hoar is found in any large cooled space such as cre- vasses, cold storage rooms, bore- holes, etc.
Kinetic growth of crystals forming any- where where a cavity, i.e., a large cooled space, is formed or present in which water vapour can be deposited under calm, still conditions [2]
Rounding surface hoarK
Surface hoar crystal with rounding of sharp edges, cor- ners and striations
SHxr	Within the snowpack; dry snow

Grains are rounding off in re- sponse to a decreasing temperature gradient
May regain strength
Notes: – It may be of interest to note more precisely the shape of hoar crystals, namely plates, cups, scrolls, needles and columns, dendrites, or composite forms [3]. Multi-day growth may also be specified.– Surface hoar deposits on freely exposed objects make up a substantial part of accumulation in the inland of Antarctica. This type of hoarfrost has been termed ‘air hoar’ (see [2] and AMS, 2000).– Crevasse hoar crystals are very similar to depth hoar.References: [1] Akitaya, 1974; [2] Seligman, 1936; [3] Jamieson & Schweizer, 2000

Clustered rounded grainsh	L
Clustered rounded crystals held by large ice-to-ice bonds; water in internal veins among three crystals or two grain boundaries
MFcl	At the surface or within the snowpack; wet snow
Wet snow at low water content (pendular regime), i.e., holding free liquid water; clusters form to minimize surface free en- ergy
Meltwater can drain; too much water leads to MFsl; first freezing leads to MFpc
Ice-to-ice bonds give strength
Rounded polycrystalsM
Individual crystals are frozen into a solid polycrystalline particle, either wet or refrozen
MFpc	At the surface or within the snowpack
Melt-freeze cycles form polycrystals when water in veins freezes; either wet at low water content (pendular regime) or refrozen
Particle size increases with num- ber of melt-freeze cycles; radiation penetration may restore MFcl; ex- cess water leads to MFsl
High strength in the frozen state; lower strength in the wet state; strength increases with number of melt-freeze cycles
SlushN
 Separated rounded particles completely immersed in water
MFsl	Water saturated, soaked snow; found within the snowpack, on land or ice surfaces, but also as a viscous floating mass in water after heavy snowfall.
Wet snow at high liquid water content (fu- nicular regime); poorly bonded, fully rounded single crystals – and polycrystals – form as ice and water are in thermody- namic equilibrium
Water drainage blocked by capil- lary barrier, impermeable layer or ground; high energy input to snow cover by solar radiation, high air temperature or water input (rain)
Little strength due to de- caying bonds
Melt-freeze crustOh
Crust of recognizable melt- freeze polycrystals
MFcr	At the surface	Crust of melt-freeze polycrystals from a surface layer of wet snow that refroze after having been wetted by melt or rainfall; found either wet or refrozen
Particle size and density increases with number of melt-freeze cycles
Strength increases with number of melt-freeze cy- cles
Notes: – Melt-freeze crusts MFcr form at the surface as layers at most a few centimetres thick, usually on top of a subfreezing snowpack. Rounded polycrystals MFpc will rather form within the snowpack. MFcr usually contain more refrozen water than MFpc and will not return to MFcl.– Both MFcr and MFpc may contain a recognizable minority of other shapes, particularly large kinetic growth form FC and DH.

Notes: – In ice formations, pores usually do not connect and no individual grains or particles are recognizable, contrary to highly porous snow. Nevertheless, some permeability remains, in particular when wetted, but to much a lesser degree than for porous melt forms.– Most often, rain and solar radiation cause the formation of melt-freeze crusts MFcr.– Discontinuous ice bodies such as ice lenses or refrozen flow fingers can be identified by appropriate remarks.References: [1] Ozeki & Akitaya, 1998

Appendix ECanadian Avalanche Association markup language (CAAML)E.1 IntroductionCanadian Avalanche Association Markup Language (CAAML) is a standard for the electronic representation of information pertinent to avalanche safety operations. By building on existing Internet standards, CAAML expresses avalanche related information in a manner that can easily be shared over the World Wide Web.CAAML builds on the following two existing standards:• Extensible markup language (XML): A general purpose markup language promoted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).• Geographic markup language (GML): An XML grammar defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium(OGC) to express geographic features.E.2 PurposeTo provide the definitions for the data file structure to support electronic exchange of avalanche related information. CAAML defines the structure and elements of observations types, specifies how locations are referenced, provides a mechanism for linking observations with each other and contains a method for associating external data files.E.3 VersionsSeveral different CAAML versions have been published since its first use in the fall of 2003. The following list briefly describes the primary stages in the development of CAAML.• CAAML V1.0.3: Initial specifications were developed to support an electronic submissions of the industrial information exchange (InfoEx®) of the CAA. These specifications were limited to support observation elements that had traditionally been exchanged in the InfoEx®.• CAAML V2.2.6: CAAML was expanded to include the majority of specification defined in theObservation Guidelines and Recording Standards (OGRS) of the CAA.• CAAML V3.0.3: In order to support more detailed geographic information in CAAML, the standard wasmodified to incorporate key elements of GML, the XML standard for geographic information.• CAAML V4.1: The file structure of CAAML schema files was redesigned to allow CAAML to be used as an international standard that is not necessarily tied to Canadian element definitions. At the same time, the schema was made fully GML compliant and additional modules for avalanche accident information and snow profile observations were added.• CAAML V5.0: The is the first version of CAAML that uses the concept of CAAML Profiles to facilitate the adoption of the CAAML standard for specific applications. CAAML Profiles are logical restrictions of the overall CAAML standard that limit the CAAML data model to elements most relevant to the specific area of interest and remove unnecessary flexibility. At the same time, profiles share a common overall structure and have many similarities, since they are all derived from the same overall CAAML standard. This new structure of CAAML aims to make it easier for developers to implement the CAAML standard.E.4 Structure (CAAML V5.0)CAAML consists of a number of XML Schema files that define the structure of any CAAML instant files. While the schema files for the complete CAAML V5.0 standard have not been published, numerous CAAML V5.0 Profiles exist to define the rules for encoding information for specific information exchange initiatives within the Canadian and international avalanche safety and research communities. See http://caaml.org/ Schemas/V5.0/Profiles for the currently available profiles.
The precise files structure of CAAML V5.0 Profiles depends on the complexity and extend of the specific profile. However, in general, a CAAML V5.0 Profile consists of the following three types of schema files.• xlinks.xsd: Definitions for xlink elements and attributes that are use in GML and CAAML to create links between individual elements and files. Xlink is W3C recommendation.• CAAMLv5_NameOfProfile_GML.xsd: A profile of GML 3.2, which includes the GML definitions required for the particular CAAML Profile.• CAAMLv5_NameOfProfile.xsd: One or more schema files that include the CAAML V5.0 definitions for the specific information exchange.E.5 AccessCAAML is under a royalty-free patent license, allowing anyone to implement it. Schema files of the various CAAML versions, example files and basic documentation can be accessed at http://caaml.org.E.6 AuthorsOriginal specifications for the CAAML schema version 1.0 were designed by the CAA’s Data and Information Committee, which included Jeff Goodrich (Parks Canada), Jan Bergstrom (Canadian Mountain Holidays), Mark Myhre (Canadian Mountain Holidays), Simon Walker (B.C. Ministry of Transportation), Evan Manners (CAC) and Pascal Haegeli (University of British Columbia). External expert knowledge was provided by Graeme Irwin (University of Calgary).All subsequent version of CAAML were primarily designed by Dr. Pascal Haegeli (Avisualanche Consulting) and Roger Atkins (Canadian Mountain Holidays). Advice on the integration of GML was provided by Dr.David Burggraf (Galdos Systems Inc.).Individual CAAML V5.0 profiles are developed at the demand and in collaboration with interested avalanche safety organizations. See http://caaml.org/Schemas/V5.0/Profiles for more information on collaborators.E.7 Suggested referencesSchema files of the various CAAML versions, example files and basic documentation can be accessed athttp://caaml.orgOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC): Open GIS ® Geography Markup Language (GML) EncodingSpecifications.

      Appendix G Stability, hazard and riskG.1 StabilityG.1.1 DefinitionStability refers to the chance that avalanches will not initiate. Stability is analysed in space and time relative to sensitivity to triggers and spatial distribution. Stability evaluation does not consider the size or potential consequences of expected avalanches; avalanche hazard and risk evaluation includes consideration of these factors. Complete definitions are provided in Sections G.2 and G.3.G.1.2 Snow stability rating systemStability ratingObservation or Triggering of AvalanchesStability test resultsNatural avalanchesTriggered avalanchesTest scoreFracture characterVery Good (VG)No natural avalanches expected.Avalanches may be triggered by very heavy loads, suchas large cornice falls, inisolated terrain features.Generally no results.No fracture or non-planar break fractures.Good (G)No natural avalanches expected.Avalanches may be triggered by heavy loads in isolated terrain features.Generally moderate to hard results.Generally resistant or non-planar break fractures.Fair(F)Isolated natural avalanches are expected on specific terrain only.Avalanches may be triggered by light loads in areas with specific terrain features or certain snowpack characteristics.Generally easy to moderate results.Resistant or sudden fractures.Poor (P)Natural avalanches are expected in areas with specific terrain features or certain snowpack characteristics.Avalanches may be triggered by light loads in many areas. Ski cuts or skier remotes possible.Generally easy results.Generally sudden fractures.Very Poor (VP)Widespread natural avalanches are expected.Widespread triggering of avalanches by light loads.Very easy to easy results.Sudden fractures.Note:	Observation or triggering of avalanches will downgrade stability over results of stability tests.For regional and larger forecast areas isolated natural avalanches may occur even when stability for the area as a whole is good.Definitions and examples• Natural avalanches: Avalanches triggered by weather events such as wind-loading, snowfall, rain, temperature changes, etc.• Triggered avalanches: Avalanches initiated by external forces on the snowpack through human action, ice- rock- and cornice-fall, explosives, wildlife, etc.• Heavy load: A cornice-fall, a compact group of people, a snowmobile, or explosives.• Light load: A single person, or a small cornice-fall.
• Isolated terrain features: Features with geographic boundaries that limit trigger points and avalanche size such as extreme terrain, steep convex rolls, localized dispersed areas (pockets) without readily specifiable characteristics, etc.• Specific terrain features: Features with identifiable characteristics such as lee slopes, sun-exposed aspects,cross-loaded slopes, etc.• Certain snowpack characteristics: Shallow snowpack with faceted grains, persistent weaknesses,identified weaknesses, etc.G.1.3 ElevationSpecify the forecast area and stability for three elevation bands if relevant:• Alpine: Upper mountain elevations where trees are very sparse or nonexistent.• Treeline: Elevation band describing the transitional area between closed forest below and open treeless areas above.• Below treeline: Terrain from valley bottom to where the mountainside forest begins to thin.Note: Stability is commonly evaluated according to elevation band because snowfall and snowdepth, wind, temperature and radiation balance, and the character and complexity of terrain features vary as a function of elevation. However, although alpine, treeline, and below treeline primarily describe elevation bands, specific terrain features may in some cases better reflect a different elevation category (i.e. under certain conditions logging cut-blocks may be considered treeline features found at below treeline elevations).G.1.4 TrendWhere practical give the expected stability trend for the next 12 to 24 hours. Use the terms: improving, steadyand decreasing to describe the trend.G.1.5 ConfidenceComment on the confidence in the ratings with reference to the quantity and consistancy of the observations and test results (i.e. low = limited relevant obs, moderate = some obs and/or inconsistent results, high = sufficient relevant obs, mostly consistent results).G.1.6 QualifiersObservers may qualify the rating based on:• Topography (aspect, slope angle, etc.)• Spatial extent (localized or widespread)• Time of day• Level of the unstable layer in the snowpack (i.e. near surface, mid level, deep)G.2 HazardG.2.1 DefinitionHazard: A source of potential harm, or a situation with the potential for causing harm, in terms of human injury; damage to health, property, the environment, and other things of value; or some combination of these (CSA, 2002).G.2.2 Hazard rating systemSeveral methods for rating avalanche hazard exist. Different operations tailor their hazard ratings to theiroperational needs. Two examples of hazard rating systems are provided.
The North American Public Avalanche Danger Scale is provided below as an example of a hazard rating system used in public avalanche bulletins.The British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure hazard rating system is provided below as an example of a hazard rating system used by a transportation avalanche safety operation.Avalanche forecastDefinitionLowAvalanches are unlikely. ORSmall avalanches are possible, but are expected to terminate far above the highwayModerateSmall avalanches are probable but are expected to terminate above the highway. AND/ORLarge avalanches are possible, but are expected to terminate far above the highway.ConsiderableSmall avalanches may affect the highway.AND/ORLarge avalanches are probable, but are expected to terminate above the highway. AND/ORSnow dust events may affect the highway.HighNumerous small avalanches are expected to affect the highway.AND/OROne or more large avalanches are expected to affect the highway.ExtremeNumerous, large avalanches are expected to affect the highway.G.3 RiskG.3.1 DefinitionRisk: The chance of injury or loss as defined as a measure of the probability and severity of an adverse effectto health, property, the environment, or other things of value (CSA, 2002).
