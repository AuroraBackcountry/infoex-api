1. **Always fetch constants first** - Enum values may change over time
2. **Cache constants** - Valid for 24 hours, refresh daily
3. **Validate locally** - Check enum values before API submission
4. **Handle validation errors** - Parse 400 responses for field-specific errors

### PUT /workflow/executionAggregate
**Description**: Update existing Workflow Execution Aggregate  
**Request Body**: Same as POST

**Response Format**: WorkflowExecutionAggregateDTO with updated execution details

**Use Case**: Modify batch submission or add additional observations to existing workflow

---

## üìã Standard Request/Response Patterns

### Common Required Fields
All observations require:
```json
{
  "obDate": "yyyy/mm/dd",
  "state": "IN_REVIEW" | "SUBMITTED"
}
```

**Note**: While `locationUUIDs` and `operationUUID` are not technically required by the API schema, they are essential for proper operation and should always be included.

**Additional Required Fields by Endpoint**:
- **Avalanche Observations**: `character`, `num`, `obTime`, `trigger`
- **Weather Observations**: None beyond common fields
- **Field Summary**: None beyond common fields  
- **Hazard Assessment**: None beyond common fields

**State Values**:
- `IN_REVIEW` - Observation needs review before submission
- `SUBMITTED` - Observation is finalized and submitted

### Common Optional Fields
```json
{
  "obTime": "HH:MM",
  "attachments": [/* attachment objects */],
  "shareLevel": "EXCHANGE" | "PRIVATE",
  "workflowExecutionUUID": "workflow-uuid",
  "createUserUUID": "user-uuid",
  "reviewUserUUID": "user-uuid",
  "submitUserUUID": "user-uuid"
}
```

**Share Level Values**:
- `EXCHANGE` - Share with InfoEx network
- `PRIVATE` - Keep within organization only

**Assessment Types** (for hazard assessments):
- `DAILY_ASSESSMENT` - Daily operational assessment
- `FORECAST_ASSESSMENT` - Forecast-based assessment
- `INCIDENT_ASSESSMENT` - Post-incident assessment

### Field Format Requirements
**Date/Time Formats**:
- `obDate`: `yyyy/mm/dd` (e.g., "2025/02/21")
- `obTime`: `HH:MM` in 24-hour format (e.g., "13:30")
- `obStartTime`/`obEndTime`: `HH:MM` format
- ISO DateTime: `yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SSZ` for workflow submissions

**Numeric Field Ranges**:
- `tempMax`/`tempMin`: Temperature in Celsius (-50 to +50)
- `elevation`: Meters above sea level (0 to 5000)
- `incline`: Slope angle in degrees (0 to 90)
- `width`/`length`: Distance in meters (0 to 10000)
- `depth`: Snow depth in centimeters (0 to 1000)
- `baro`: Barometric pressure in hPa (800 to 1100)
- `rh`: Relative humidity percentage (0 to 100)

**UUID Format**: All UUIDs must be valid UUID v4 format (e.g., "f1b3b3b3-3b3b-3b3b-3b3b-3b3b3b3b3b3b")

### Standard Error Responses
- **400**: Bad Request (validation errors)
- **401**: Unauthorized (invalid API key)
- **403**: Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- **404**: Not Found (invalid UUID)
- **409**: Conflict (duplicate submission)

**Example Error Response (400 - Validation Error)**:
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "obDate",
      "error": "REQUIRED",
      "errorDetails": "obDate is required"
    },
    {
      "field": "windSpeed",
      "error": "INVALID_FORMAT",
      "errorDetails": "windSpeed must be one of: C, L, M, S, X, V"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example Error Response (401 - Unauthorized)**:
```json
{
  "message": "Invalid API key",
  "status": "UNAUTHORIZED"
}
```

### Success Response
- **200**: OK with observation object returned

**Example Success Response**:
```json
{
  "uuid": "generated-observation-uuid",
  "obDate": "2025/02/21",
  "state": "SUBMITTED",
  "locationUUIDs": ["location-uuid"],
  "operationUUID": "operation-uuid"
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Problems
- **401 Unauthorized**: Check API key validity and format
- **403 Forbidden**: Verify operation UUID permissions
- **Missing Headers**: Ensure both `api_key` and `operation` headers are present

### Validation Errors (400)
- **Invalid Enum Values**: Use `/observation/constants/` to get current valid values
- **Date Format**: Use `yyyy/mm/dd` format (e.g., "2025/02/21")
- **Time Format**: Use 24-hour `HH:MM` format (e.g., "13:30")
- **UUID Format**: Ensure UUIDs are valid v4 format

### Location Issues
- **404 Location Not Found**: Verify location exists using `GET /location`
- **Invalid Location Type**: Check location type matches observation requirements
- **Missing locationUUIDs**: Always include at least one location UUID

### Common Field Validation
- **Wind Speed**: Must be one of: C, L, M, S, X, V
- **Wind Direction**: Must be cardinal direction (N, NE, E, etc.) or VAR/ALL
- **Avalanche Size**: Use numeric values (1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5)
- **Temperature**: Reasonable ranges (-50¬∞C to +50¬∞C)

## üéØ Aurora Daily Report Submission Order

### Recommended Order of Operations
This is a general guideline for the sequence of API calls when submitting a complete Aurora daily report:

1. **`GET /observation/constants/`** - Get validation constants for enum values
2. **`GET /location`** - Resolve zone names to InfoEx location UUIDs
3. **`POST /observation/fieldSummary`** - Submit daily field weather and conditions (primary report)
4. **`POST /observation/avalancheSummary`** - Submit avalanche activity summary (if applicable)
5. **`POST /observation/snowpackAssessment`** - Submit snowpack summary (general conditions)
6. **`POST /observation/snowpack`** - Submit detailed snow profile observation (if collected)
7. **`POST /observation/avalanche`** - Submit individual avalanche observations (if any observed)
8. **`POST /observation/hazardAssessment`** - Submit avalanche problems and hazard ratings
9. **`POST /observation/terrain`** - Submit terrain considerations and ATES ratings
10. **`POST /pwl`** - Create/update persistent weak layer tracking (2-3 times per season)

### Aurora Payload Templates
All payload templates are available in `infoex-api-payloads/` directory:
- `field_summary.json` - Daily operational summary
- `avalanche_summary.json` - Avalanche activity overview
- `snowpack_summary.json` - General snowpack conditions (via `/observation/snowpackAssessment`)
- `snowProfile_observation.json` - Detailed snow profiles (via `/observation/snowpack`)
- `avalanche_observation.json` - Individual avalanche details
- `hazard_assessment.json` - Hazard ratings and problems
- `terrain_observation.json` - Terrain observations
- `pwl_persistent_weak_layer.json` - PWL creation and retrieval

### Aurora-Specific Notes
- **No Weather Station Operations**: Aurora does not submit weather observations (`POST /observation/weather`) since it's not a weather station operation. Weather observations are typically submitted by:
  - Heli-ski operations with weather stations
  - Remote automated weather stations  
  - Ski resorts with consistent morning/evening observations
- **Field Weather vs Weather Observations**: Aurora captures weather conditions in the field summary rather than as standalone weather observations
- **Conditional Submissions**: Avalanche observations/summary (steps 3-4) only occur when avalanches were actually observed
- **Flexible Order**: This sequence is a guideline - the actual order can vary based on data availability and operational needs

```
D                  - Dry (0%) - Usually T < 0¬∞C, but dry snow can occur at any temperature up to 0¬∞C. Disaggregated snow grains have little tendency to adhere to each other when pressed together, as in making a snowball
M                  - Moist (<3%) - T = 0¬∞C. Water is not visible even at 10x magnification. When lightly crushed, the snow has a distinct tendency to stick together
W                  - Wet (3-8%) - T = 0¬∞C. Water can be recognized at 10x magnification by its meniscus between adjacent snow grains, but water cannot be pressed out by moderately squeezing the snow in the hands (pendular regime)
U                  - Unknown

Note: InfoEx API uses simplified 4-level water content classification (D, M, W, U) rather than the full OGRS 6-level system.
```
