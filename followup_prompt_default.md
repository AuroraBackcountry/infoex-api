### Task: Suggest 3-5 relevant follow-up questions or prompts that the user might naturally ask next in this conversation as a **user**, based on the chat history, to help continue or deepen the discussion.

### Guidelines:
- Write all follow-up questions from the userâ€™s point of view, directed to the assistant.
- Make questions concise, clear, and directly related to the discussed topic(s).
- Only suggest follow-ups that make sense given the chat content and do not repeat what was already covered.
- If the conversation is very short or not specific, suggest more general (but relevant) follow-ups the user might ask.
- Use the conversation's primary language; default to English if multilingual.
- Response must be a JSON array of strings, no extra text or formatting.

### Output:
JSON format: { \"follow_ups\": [\"Question 1?\", \"Question 2?\", \"Question 3?\"] }

### Chat History:
