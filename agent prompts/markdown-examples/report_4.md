Daily Operational Report



Date: 2025-07-08  

Zone: Sea to Sky Gondola (STSG)  

Guide(s): Ben Johns  



Operational Summary:  

Guided two guests from the Sea to Sky Gondola to Ledge Trees. Skied four laps in excellent powder (≈20 cm new snow) and returned to the lodge by 14:00 when the guests became tired. Travel and skiing were confined to north-aspect glades above 1 800 m; egress was via the upper trail to avoid open creek crossings low down.



Field Wx Obs:  

•Wind: S mod (~20 km h⁻¹) (L)  

•Max Temp: −1 °C  

•Min Temp: −5 °C  

•Precip: Nil  

•HS: 250 cm  

•HN24: 20 cm  

•Sky: BKN  



Snow Conditions and Quality:  

Widespread dry powder with 20 cm of new storm snow (HST 30 cm) sitting over a supportive mid-winter base. Ski quality was excellent; no crusts encountered. Creek openings present below 1 200 m.



Avalanche Problems:  

Storm Slab  

•N aspects > 1 800 m  

•Distribution: specific  

•Likelihood: possible  

•Size: 1  



Wind Slab  

•Immediate lee of ridges, N aspects > 1 800 m  

•Distribution: specific  

•Likelihood: possible  

•Size: 1  



Avalanche Observations and Instability:  

None observed; no cracking, whumpfing, or other signs of instability.



Snow Pack Description:  

No formal snow profiles dug. A 20 cm storm slab overlays ~30 cm of recent snow, sitting on a well-settled 2.5 m winter base. Overall structure appeared strong, with bonding improving through the day.



Avalanche Hazard Assessment:  

Alpine: Moderate (2)  

TL: Moderate (2)  

BTL: Low (1)  



Summary of Key Evidence:  

•Weather: Moderate S winds and 20 cm of new snow formed small slabs on lee terrain.  

•Snowpack: New snow over a firm base; no weak layers noted but limited observations.  

•Avalanche Observations: None, supporting Moderate or lower hazard.  

•Avalanche Problems: Storm and wind slabs specific to high north terrain, warranting Moderate hazard above treeline.



Other Hazards:  

Creek holes and open water on the lower exit trail.



Risk Management:  

Selected sheltered, low-consequence runs; avoided lee ridge-top start zones; exited high to bypass creek hazards; finished early as temperatures began to rise.



Strategic Mindset:  

Status quo—cautious terrain use with continued monitoring of new-snow bonding.



Expectations for the Coming Days:  

A forecast shift to colder, clear weather should preserve powder quality and gradually tighten the storm slab. Wind slabs may remain sensitive on high, shaded lee slopes.



Additional Report Comments:  

None.
