# InfoEx Submission Success Guide

## Quick Reference: What Success Looks Like

### ✅ SUCCESSFUL Submission
```
avalanche_summary: Successfully submitted to InfoEx
  - UUID: [any value or null]
  - State: IN_REVIEW
  - Response Code: 200
```

**This means:**
- ✅ Data was pushed to InfoEx successfully
- ✅ InfoEx accepted and stored the submission
- ✅ Submission is in draft mode (IN_REVIEW) or final (SUBMITTED) based on auto_submit setting
- ✅ Everything worked correctly!

### ❌ FAILED Submission
```
avalanche_summary: Failed - [error message] (Response Code: 400/401/500)
```

**This means:**
- ❌ Data did NOT reach InfoEx
- ❌ Need to fix the error and try again

## Key Points

1. **Response Code 200 = SUCCESS** - This is the most important indicator
2. **UUID is optional** - Some InfoEx endpoints don't return UUIDs consistently
3. **State shows draft vs final** - Controlled by auto_submit flag:
   - `auto_submit: false` → State: IN_REVIEW (draft)
   - `auto_submit: true` → State: SUBMITTED (final)

## What to Tell Users

### On Success (Response Code 200):
"✅ Your [observation type] has been successfully submitted to InfoEx in [draft/final] mode. The data is now saved in the InfoEx system."

### On Failure:
"❌ There was an issue submitting to InfoEx: [error message]. Let me help you fix this..."

## Remember
- The push to InfoEx is what matters
- UUID is just a tracking number
- Response Code 200 means it worked
- State tells you if it's draft or final
