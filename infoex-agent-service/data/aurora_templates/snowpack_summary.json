    "snowpackSummary": "Comprehensive snowpack assessment for the forecast area. Widespread surface hoar layer (2-4mm crystals) buried 30-40cm below surface under recent storm snow. This interface is creating a reactive weak layer across multiple aspects and elevations. Storm snow loading: 30cm over 48 hours with moderate density (SWE 30mm). Stability test results from multiple locations: CT12-CT18 with Q1-Q2 sudden planar failures at the surface hoar interface. Extended column tests (ECTP15-20) demonstrate propagation potential across the weak layer. Rutschblock scores of RB3-RB4 confirm sensitivity. Spatial distribution: Most reactive on north through east aspects at treeline and alpine elevations. Below treeline shows better structure with forest anchoring. South and west aspects have melt-freeze crusts providing some stability. Primary concern: Human-triggered avalanches on wind-loaded terrain, steep convexities, and unsupported slopes. Size 2-2.5 avalanches possible. Recommend conservative terrain choices, avoid wind-loaded features, and careful snowpack assessment before committing to steep terrain.",
