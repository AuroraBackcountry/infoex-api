Maximum slope angles encountered were 35 degrees on wind-sheltered north aspects during approach. Afternoon: Maintained conservative terrain choices on descent, avoiding steep wind-loaded features and convexities above treeline. Risk management: Implemented terrain anchors (trees, ridge features) for safe travel. Used spacing protocols on steeper sections (one-at-a-time exposure on 30+ degree slopes). Maintained visual contact and clear communication. Identified retreat options at all decision points. No exposure to overhead avalanche hazard. Group stayed below ridgeline on descent to avoid wind-loaded slopes.
