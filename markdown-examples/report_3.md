Daily Operational Report



Date: 2025/03/02

Zone: Whistler Blackcomb (Decker Mountain)

Guide(s): Mo, Vince, and Severin



Operational Summary:

Today, 8 guests joined us on an adventure to the summit of Decker Mountain via the south faces and Lower Disease Ridge. We encountered spring conditions with overcast skies and calm winds, which led to decent skiing in areas where the crust was supportable and beginning to soften.



Field Wx Obs:

•Wind: Calm

•Max Temp: 2°C in the Alpine

•Min Temp: -3°C

•Precip: No precipitation

•HS: 150-200 cm

•HN24: 0 cm

•Sky: Overcast



Snow Conditions and Quality:

We found a widespread crust of varying integrity up to 2400m, with widespread crusts affecting skiing quality. There was a corn cycle observed on east aspects and terrain below 1900m. The snow quality was decent on terrain where the crust was supportable and beginning to soften, but challenging elsewhere.



Avalanche Problems:

Loose Wet

•Location: Low elevation terrain in the afternoon or solar-facing terrain

•Distribution: Specific

•Likelihood: Possible

•Size: 2



Avalanche Observations and Instability:

No avalanches or signs of instability were observed today.



Snow Pack Description:

The snowpack had a surface crust observed up to 2400m, overlying 10-30cm of moist snow depending on aspect and elevation. The Feb 16 SH/FC interface, down 40-80cm, was not reactive to skier traffic.



Avalanche Hazard Assessment:



Alpine: Moderate (2)

TL: Moderate (2)

BTL: Low (1)



Summary of Key Evidence:

Weather: Calm winds and overcast skies prevent significant warming, which maintains moderate conditions.
Snowpack: The presence of a surface crust and SH/FC interface suggests moderate stability.
Avalanche Observations: No recent avalanche activity was observed, supporting a moderate hazard level.
Avalanche Problems: Loose wet avalanches are only possible and specific, indicating a manageable risk.


Other Hazards:

The main concern was the poor ski quality due to a breakable crust, which required careful terrain selection to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience.



Risk Management:

The team managed risks through strategic terrain selection, prioritizing simple to challenging terrain with the best chances for solar softening.



Strategic Mindset:

The mindset adopted was "spring diurnal," reflecting the focus on managing the risks associated with the diurnal freeze-thaw cycle.



Expectations for the Coming Days:

Expect surface crusts to form during the night and deteriorate during the day until the anticipated precipitation event on Tuesday/Wednesday.
