Daily Operational Report



Date: 2025/02/21

Zone: Whistler Blackcomb, Corral Zone in the Musical Bumps

Guide(s): Ben Johns



Operational Summary: Today, Ben Johns guided two guests in the Whistler Blackcomb area, specifically in the Corral Zone of the Musical Bumps. The group enjoyed skiing in good snow conditions above 1500 meters, completing three laps in total. The day was characterized by overcast to obscure sky conditions with temperatures ranging from 0째C to -2째C and strong to moderate winds at ridge tops from the south.



Field Wx Obs:

Wind: Strong to moderate at ridge tops from the south
Max Temp: 0째C
Min Temp: -2째C
Precip: Snowing at S2 intensity
HS: 2 meters
HN24: 30 cm
Sky: Overcast to obscure


Snow Conditions and Quality: Above 1500 meters, the snow was in good condition for skiing, while below 1500 meters, the snow became moist.



Avalanche Problems:

Storm Slabs
Location: Specific terrain, north aspects, sheltered treeline, and below treeline to 1500 m
Distribution: Specific
Likelihood: Possible
Size: 1.5
Wind Slabs
Location: Immediately lee of ridgeline and exposed terrain in the Alpine and treeline
Distribution: Specific
Likelihood: Possible
Size: 1.5


Avalanche Observations and Instability: No avalanches were observed today. However, signs of instability were noted, including whumpfing and cracking on steep slopes above 1500 meters.



Snow Pack Description: The snowpack consists of 15 to 30 cm of HN24 sitting on surfaces like surface hoar or faceted snow, with generally colder snow below this layer. No further observations were made.



Avalanche Hazard Assessment:

Alpine: Considerable (3)
TL: Moderate (2)
BTL: Moderate (2)


Summary of Key Evidence:

Weather: Strong to moderate winds and 30 cm of new snow enhance the potential for wind and storm slab avalanches.
Snowpack: Surface hoar and faceted snow layers increase the likelihood of instability, particularly above 1500 meters.
Avalanche Observations: Whumpfing and cracking suggest potential weaknesses.
Avalanche Problems: Identified storm and wind slabs support the hazard assessment.


Other Hazards: Heavy snow at lower elevations poses a risk, along with open creeks and buried hazards such as logs and stumps.



Risk Management: Risk was managed by maintaining awareness of snowpack weaknesses and avoiding high-risk areas based on observed instability signs.



Strategic Mindset: The strategic mindset adopted today was "status quo," relying on good information about conditions and minimal caution required in the terrain.



Expectations for the Coming Days: Temperatures are expected to rise, potentially causing the current powder snow above 1500 m to become heavy and moist. A drop in temperatures on Sunday is expected to improve conditions, making the Duffy Zone an optimal skiing location.
